Fuck the World (Summer in London)TranslationsPortuguêsTürkçeFuck the World (Summer in London) Lyrics[Chorus]
Wanna fuck the world I’m a walkin' erection
Spend without a thought, we do it reckless
Your nigga caught us texting
You said, “Baby don’t be mad, you know how Brent is”

[Verse 1]
Don’t open your mouth if you ain’t speaking good to me
I ain’t built like him
You fuckin' with a G
Just 'cause I fuck you, that don’t mean I trust you, I don’t
You got some high hopes
High hopes, baby
Fuck me crazy and I’ll tell you 'bout me
I was nothin' at all
Took a trip to London just to hear how they talk
Back to 410
You should hear how they talk
He might be Mr. Track and Field but I done ran through 'em all
Yeah that nigga play D1 but you still watch how we ball
I ain’t never home for long but you pull up when I call
All the hood niggas respect me
Strippers wanna sex me
You bluffed on him
Now he mad because you let me
If it ain’t fucked up don’t change it
I’d prolly be dead if I was basic
Would you still give me head if I had day shifts?
I work when I want
I do what I want
She get what she want
I call her my wishing wand
Wash it off when you top me off you know I be slumped
[Chorus]
Wanna fuck the world I’m a walkin' erection
Spend without a thought, we do it reckless
Your nigga caught us texting
You said, “Baby don’t be mad, you know how Brent is”
Your nigga caught us texting
You said, “Baby don’t be mad, you know how Brent is”

[Verse 2]
Don’t come around, if you ain’t close to me
I ain’t built like them, you gotta work for me
Just 'cause I haunt you it don’t mean I want you, I don’t
You got some high hopes

Just some peace is all I need
So why can't I get that for free?

I gave it all for a fantasy
Is anybody gon' remember me?

Forty thousand (Forty thousand)

Your judgement get clouded when you clouted
My opposition wish I'd stop smilin'
My family wish I'd stop wildin'
I'm still on the east side smokin' with my OG's
'Cause they the only ones that really know me
I was fuckin' superstars when I was nineteen (Mm)
The shit we did, you won't believe me
Now I'm at the turn up, lookin' lonely
Then they wonder why I'm quiet at them house parties
'Cause everybody see me (See me)
Roll some blunts and hit her once and now she need me (Need me)
Her nigga wanna be me (Yeah)

[Verse 4: Drake]
Yeah
The Ten Thousand Building, get your ass an apartment
Put you inside a G-Class, that's just a starter kit
Plenty things count in life, but none of them is a thought of it
New piece around my neck, it's chest games
'Cause shorty stay with calculatin' moves, like Beth Harmon
Swear I'm more "Purple Rain" Prince than Prince Charmin'
Disappointment, I stay expectin' it, the pessimist gold medalist
Flushed the Magnums just so they not collectin' my specimens, damn (Damn)
The way she with papi, man, you would think she's a veteran on remembrance
Cleanin' lady sweep the room daily for all the evidence
Of everything I ever did (I ever did)
Do they have a pool there? Do they have a gym there?
You used to do skincare, but now you do swimwear
Your ex-roommate got a condo that's downtown
But she got no furniture in the crib, I've been there (Been there)
Checkmate, even though you hate that I even check her
I'll still get an E for effort
Only time I play the back and forth is Aaliyah record
If I let you talk first, then nobody is speakin' second
Fluent in passive aggression, that's why you actin' dismissive
Hearin' me out for once would require you actually listen, damn (Damn)
The boy is back, I never turned my back
I just lapped 'em, so now all that they see is my back
Say that then, Maybach Benz with me in the back
When I was in Acura, still couldn't clean up my act
Whenever I tell the truth, you feel like you bein' attacked
But that come with bein' attached, so how 'bout we leave it at that? (Leave it at that)

If you're gonna waste your time
Then waste your time with me
You can have all the space

Gang Over LuvGang Over Luv Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was hella broke then, I ain't have a dime
But I was always focused, I ain't waste no time
I ain't have a car in my name, I used to walk to work every day
Me and my dawg, like it or not, I came out alright

[Pre-Chorus]
All the homies, we came up the same way
And I swear ain't nothing change
Got a little bit of change in my pocket but I maintain
We were young and in this world, chasin' dreams and girls
Runnin' from our problems
I know that we older now, but that's what we were all about
[Chorus]
I remember we were young, young and dumb
Just some niggas in a rush to grow up
I remember we were young, young and dumb
It was gang over luv, that was us

[Verse 2]
I remember we would cut class, my teachers used to hate me
The only reason that I did that was to keep from goin' crazy
I didn't give a damn 'bout my grades
That's probably why we failed the ninth grade
Me and my dawg, like it or not, we came out okay

[Pre-Chorus]
All the homies, we came up the same way
And I swear ain't nothing change
Way before I ever moved out the house and did the damn thing
We were young and in this world chasin' dreams and girls
Runnin' from our problems
& I know we're older now, but that's what we were all about

[Verse 1]
Everyday, I come late
Wash my clothes in the same sink
I don't give a damn 'bout what they think
As long as I pay rent
I don't even whine 'bout my paycheck
I know it is short, but I make ends
'Cause it could be a worse situation
[Pre-Chorus]
All that glitters ain't gold
And all that shines bright ain't a diamond
And all that wrinkles isn't old
And as far as you see ain't the horizon

[Chorus]
A death in designer (Ain't everything)
To live on an island (Ain't everything)
We keep on tryin' (To have everything)
We'll end up dyin' (Over anything)

[Verse 2]
Everyday, I leave late
I wait out front in the same place
And I don't give a damn 'bout what they say
Long as the day ends
I made some plans with some good friends
I don't even know where the day went
But it could be the worst conversation

Part II: Nobody Carez

Everybody want a motherfuckin' Benz or Beamer
Designer sneakers, ain't no motherfuckin' dreamers
Shit is deeper than Neiman
Mark us on your Hollywood starlets
Underneath there's niggas starvin', impoverished
People don't give no fucks, nigga
Trump don't give a fuck
Your niggas don't give a fuck
Your favorite artists don't give a motherfuckin' fuck
Do you give a fuck, nigga?

[Interlude 2]
Keep playin', motherfucker
[Chorus]
If you told 'em you was down and out
Would they pull up or would they wait it out?
Would they ever call you just to talk about
Whatever they wanna talk about?
If you borrowed money 'cause it's life or death
Would they ask you for their money back?
Would they tell the world all of your business?
And this and that? Your business and this and that

[Verse 1]
Maybe, you're too friendly or maybe you're too real
You put your time and faith in people that can't seal the deal
Trials and tribulation often force one to reveal
That maybe you just don't know what to feel
Did you know you were you with the devil last night?
Couldn't see where you was goin' with a flashlight
I know it burns, I'm just concerned. When will you learn?
I know that you were with the devil last night
& Baby I ain't sayin' you don't act right
This world don't love but that don't mean that you can't hope it does

If you told em you was down and out
Would they pull up or would they wait it out?
Would they ever call you just to talk about

Why don't we make it easier for the world to change someday?
Sometimes I contemplate, some things my heart can't take

Love can trump it all

And know you a star, you just have to believe in who you are
Who can you love?

Don't let 'em make you feel like the world can't heal
It's hard out here
Despite your fears, keep holdin' on
With all those tears, you can't hold 'em on
And how?
Could somebody else know you, if you don't know you, you're searchin'

JACKIE BROWNTranslationsEspañolJACKIE BROWN Lyrics[Chorus]
Only been a few hours, but it felt like days
Only been days, but it feel like months
I been gone for a year, only wrote like once
Life moves fast when you do what you want
I guess I'm doing what I want
Hope you doing what you want (What else?)
But what you want?
(I don't know)

[Verse 1]
My new bitch look like Halle Berry
But she don't love me, she too scary
My old bitch fine like Jackie Brown
I don't wanna love her, she too down
Will you be my leading lady?
I want a contract, girl no maybe
In the meantime (I guess I'm doing what I want)
Get some me-time (Hope you doing what you want)
[Bridge]
Maybе I don't love myself, I don't know
Leavе me here, I'll fuck myself
She be in the mirror, I duck myself
I don't need much so fuck my wealth

[Chorus]
Only been a few hours, but it felt like days
Only been days, but it feel like months
I been gone for a year, only wrote like once
Life moves fast when you do what you want
I guess I'm doing what I want (You don't gotta front when life's a water front)
Hope you doing what you want (What else?)
But what you want?
(I don't know)
(You could play it loud?)

[Verse 2]
Crib by the beach like Ordell
No Beaumont, my killers don't tell
Chateau Marmont grabbed the Louis off the shelf
Now my bitch addicted to Chanel
Will you be my leading lady?
I want a contract, girl no maybe
In the meantime (I guess I'm doing what I want)
Get some me-time (I don't know)
(Hope you doing what you want)

But she don't love me, she too scary

NeededNeeded Lyrics[Verse 1]
Save your breath, don't even speak on me now
You and your friends, ran my name to the ground
You left me then, so I figured it out
Save your tongue, don't even give me a call
If I was a bum, you wouldn't call me at all
I don't say it enough, I'm gettin' tired of y'all

[Chorus]
Ohh, you say you're so happy for me
That you always knew what I would be
Where was the love when it was needed?
Ohh, you say that now I'm all you see
And you always saw the light in me
Where was the light when it was needed?
[Verse 2]
Why you feel the need to apologize to me?
Some may call it out, I just call it how I see
Loved me when you knew me
You just ain't want anybody to know
I changed my number twice and you called again
Heard that I was movin' and asked all my friends where to
If I don't wanna be close, it's nothing personal

[Chorus]
Ohh, you say you're so happy for me
Said you always knew what I would be
Where was the love when it was needed?
Ohh, you say that now I'm all you see
And you always saw the light in me
Where was the light when it was needed?

[Bridge]
I don't want a reason you didn't believe in me
That's your decision, don't get me wrong
I know you'd come around over time
I don't need your blessing
Don't need you protestin' how I live my life
I'm tryin', I'm fine

[Chorus]
Ohh, you say you're so happy for me

Where was the love when it was needed?

I stood off by the wall and watched them skip the line
One night it's gon' be me inside
God damn, it ain't easy, let me tell ya
Account is overdrawn
Doin' sessions in the valley every other night
Connections only get you so far, so far
But oh, what a feeling (How it feels) oh, what a thrill (You would kill)
To look down from these hills, put the life I knew behind, but still
It's don't feel for real, 'cause I still ain't ate a meal
My stomach growlin' but I'm fuckin' stylin'
Spent my last 20 drunk, and Uber ridin'
Ain't nobody cuttin' checks, if you ain't happy smilin'
That's shit takes all the talent, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
And it ain't easy, let me tell ya, account is overdrawn
Doin' sessions in the valley every other night and it goes on and on

Yet, I'm proud that I'm chasin' something
It's all in all better than bein' broke, bored, and back at home
Oh, yes, it's all about makin' somethin'
That's all in all bigger than anything I'd ever known

[Verse 2]
L.A, L.A, the sun can shine vicious
Poor folks and tall riches, and plus the bitches
I stood off by the wall and watched 'em pick a side
One day from now, we all could die
God damn, it ain't easy, let me tell ya
Account is overdrawn
Doin' sessions in the valley every other night
Connections only get you so far, so far
But oh, what a feelin' (How it feels) oh, what a thrill (You would kill)
To look down from these hills, put the life I knew behind, but still
This don't feel for real, 'cause I still can't cut a deal

Spent my last 20 buyin' drinks for homies
And everybody want to know me, just to say, "You owe me"

Fuckin' hella, I been on a roll
'Bout to cop a Rover for the snow
Niggas wanna come 'round, niggas better know
(Damn)
Stressed out
What's even worse is this is how I get my checks now
We all guilty, I know niggas who ain't getting out
Why do I feel cursed if I'm so blessed now? (Why?)

[Hook]
And you say you don't miss me, then you miss me
Miss me with all that
Tried to cut my baby loose and she came right back
You say that you miss me, then you miss me
Miss me with all of that
Tried to cut my baby loose and she came right back

[Outro]
I know you lying like shit

[Skit]
Like, who the fuck would wanna be these niggas
I sent that video and she said thank you
Like real live like, we wanted you, you feel me
Like, we tryna see
If I book that shit, it's a wrap
I think I did, though
Part of me feel bad for these niggas, honestly
But like, fuck it for real
Right now it feels like everything's fallin', right
It's fallin' right into place
Everything we got now, we gettin'
It's like coming to fruition
Bro, it's crazy, 'cause it's like, the way niggas is movin' now
It's like we makin' moves, and it's like, we already plottin'
And lookin' past this shit, that we already
You feel me, like, man, that's the way it gotta be
They gone be sick to see where niggas at in like two years
Five years, ten years
And this only the beginning, too
For real, like
These niggas still like three, four steps behind and shit
Yeah, like
They still on the same shit we was on like, five years ago and shit
Yeah, like
I would hate to be these niggas, bro, like
Like, you got no clue
Just imagine being like, a nigga that's not me, like
Makes me wanna throw up
That shit sound fucked up, but it's like
Nigga, I do not want to be you

Natural ReleaseNatural Release Lyrics[Verse]
She come from a hostile place
Bruises on her pretty face
Travel to a foreign land
Married to a foreign man
The ocean's blue and the weather's nice
But life is far from paradise
She picks up a magazine
And she's turned on by what she sees
Close the door and shut the blinds
She's about to ease her mind
Thoughts of peace and happiness
Travel to her finger tips
He comes home to rest his head
He walks upstairs to go to bed
He hears her moaning through the door
He goes downstairs into the drawer
He sees a box and takes it out
Then, aims the gun into his mouth
She hears a bang and she runs downstairs
To see her husband lying there
Close the door and shut the blinds
She fights off tears and dries her eyes
Thoughts of peace and happiness
They're all gone (gone)

Show U OffTranslationsTürkçeFrançaisShow U Off Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know you feelin' down 'bout how they treat you
Nobody understands all that you been through
And you just wanna get love the way you show love
It's hard to picture life being in your shoes
You ain't in touch with your baby father
You only gettin' older and it gets harder
He said he was in love, but wasn't on his job
You got your whole paycheck that says, "You'll get through"

[Chorus]
I don't wanna keep you down (Don't wanna keep you down)
A nigga wanna raise you up, yeah (Wanna raise you up)
And someone gotta take you out (Gotta take you out)
Someone's gotta show you off (Gotta show you off)
[Verse 2]
Who's gonna call you "baby"
And never make you feel small? (I'm here for you)
Who's gonna love you crazy?
I'm never gonna let you fall
I know you ain't lookin', but if you're lookin'
Then look no further
Because you're worth it, girl
I got all this love for you
'Cause you deserve it (Fuck 'em if they don't see)
You're Black and perfect

[Chorus]
I don't wanna keep you down, oh (Don't wanna keep you down)
A nigga wanna raise you up, yeah (Wanna raise you up)
And someone gotta take you out (Gotta take you out)
Somebody's gotta show you off, girl (Gotta show you off)

[Bridge]
I just wanna show you what the world don't (They do, they do)
I just wanna give you what the world won't (They won't, they won't)
Know that you will never have to feel alone, alone (Baby)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna keep you down (Don't wanna keep you down)
A nigga wanna raise you up, yeah (Wanna raise you up)
And someone gotta take you out, mm-mm (Gotta take you out)
Somebody's gotta show you off

VILLAIN’S THEMETranslationsEspañolVILLAIN’S THEME Lyrics[Intro: Brent Faiyaz & Jorja Smith]
Temporary euphoria, or a release
Hm, yeah, especially if you constantly gotta work
And do things that you might not wanna do (Mhm)
That's like temporary happiness real quick, it's an escape
And I make music about that because I feel it gets to a point
Where you live so much of your life in that state because you work so damn much (Ah)
It's been years and I been doin' the same shit
(Motherfuckers like to use that word, "Toxic")
(But that's the Internet word that people like to attach to shit)
I don't think that's an Internet word
I think that's a real word that really mеans something
Temporary euphoria (Mothеrfuckers like this the new shit though)
(Motherfuckers like, "You never heard")
Toxic's been around for, like, centuries
It's like I'm out this muhfucka for a lil' bit, while you bullshittin'
It's an escape, that's how I feel about it (Hm)
Shakespeare used it, that's a Twitter word
The Taming of the Shrew, anything that doesn't apply to you, feel me?
Yeah, it's like, you feel me (Rainbows and butterflies)
I fuck around, drink, and bullshit (They gon' be like, "It was toxic")
Bustin' random chicks and pop some E and bullshit
(But if you sing that, the people want you to make some shit that's romantic, or sweet)
It's like, "Fuck it," like, it's an escape
(So if you sing some real shit, like what's toxic, what's real)
Honestly, truthfully, okay, I get that
I feel like I know I gotta wake up in the morning and go to work (I feel like there can be a-uh, maybe)
So lemme bullshit for the night (There's like a thin line)
(This right here euphoria, the thing that come with this shit) Or a release
(This, is, uh-uh, it's like reality times ten)
(Every year before like ten years)
(As far as the people that you meet)
(The places that you go)
Temporary euphoria, or a release
(So it's because of that, naturally I'm gonna approach shit)
(A little more in retrospect, and it might come out harsh)
(But I think it's just more honest)
(Let's just keep that shit honest, fuck it)
