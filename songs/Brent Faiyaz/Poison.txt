I feel like there's no such thing as a relationship with condoms
It's one that won't last
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'? Real shit
Gotta go raw, I know that’s what Fabe do
Damn, yeah, that's real
You know, you know what they say, without is better, so
No pull out game, pull out game weak, no condom
That's what they say?
That's what they—, that's what they say
And girls hate condoms too, everybody hate condoms
Yeah, condoms are just terrible dog
Except for the people who got burned before
Niggas need‚ niggas need to live like the 70's and shit
I mean shit, if we talkin' and we doin' our thing bro, after two three times bro, that shit like—
Two or three? This nigga said the first time
For real?
Yeah
What'd you say, did you do it?
I said no, ah
I was, I was scared
It's funny how certain bitches you'll hit raw, and then the other ones you just like
Yo, it's just the vibe dog
Yeah, you gotta feel the vibe
It's the vibe bro, yeah, some, some, they try to push up on you, I be like "woah, woah, what are you doing?"
It's scary as sh—, I gotta, I gotta be the one pressuring you to fuck raw, yeah
If you ask me, then I'll get a little bit turned off by it
Yeah, that's true
I'll start thinkin' who the fuck else she done asked
Word, word, that's true
I don't be thinking so—

I might just die tonight
But you know I'm still coming through baby (Through baby)
I know it's bad for me
And you know it tastes so sweet
I think I need your abuse baby (Abuse, baby)

Girl, you do damage to me

Ain't nothing better for me now
Girl, you do damage to me
Know I love it, yeah, I love you
Ain't nothing better for me now
Than your poison baby

[Verse 2]
Angel of the night
Drown between your thighs
I'm still here, ain't no excuse baby (Excuse baby)
I see you in my sleep
I'm scarred beyond belief
Ain't nothing you can't make me do, baby (Do, baby)

Girl, you do damage to me
Know I love it, yeah, I love you
Ain't nothing better for me now
Girl, you do damage to me
Know I love it, yeah, I love you
Ain't nothing better for me now

Girl, you know I play my role when I'm inside that
With my hands around your throat
I know you like that
Girl, I'll do anything
To hear you scream my name, I love your game
I do, I do

Girl, you do damage to me
But I love it babe
Oh, you're poisonous baby10Embed
