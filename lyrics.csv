Darling, you You give, but you cannot take love  [Verse 2: Drake] Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different Started realizing a couple places I could take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation And influence a generation that's lacking in patience I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone Looking like you came from the seventies on your own My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is ""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?"" You don't even know what you want from love anymore I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for?

Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't? Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
