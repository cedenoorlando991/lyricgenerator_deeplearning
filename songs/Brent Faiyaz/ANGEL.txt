23 ContributorsANGEL Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah ohh, oh-oh
Ohhh

[Verse 1]
I look in the mirror
And I see the worst in parts of me
That I don't want, but I'd never tell you that
I'd never tell you that
And you look amazing
So how can I stand watching you be? And I feel small
Damn, I wish I could change all that
I wish I could change all that

[Chorus]
But from what I know, you'll never go away
Don't ever leave my side, baby, I'll die
But from what I know, you're always here to stay
You're an angel in disguise

[Verse 2]
Living in hell
And maybe you'll save me in the end, I need your help
And I'm here if you need mine
(You need mine)
When I'm overwhelmed
I take a vacation in my head and don't bring no one else
I guess you could come sometime
(Come some time)
You might also like[Chorus]
But from what I know, you'll never go away
Don't ever leave my side, girl I'll die
But from what I know, you're always here to stay
You're an angel in disguise

[Bridge]
An angel, an angel
An angel, an angel
An angel, an angel
Angel, angel
An angel, an angel
(An angel in disguise, you're an angel in disguise)
An angel, an angel
(An angel in disguise, you're an angel in disguise)
An angel, an angel
(An angel in disguise, you're an angel in disguise)
An angel, an angel
(An angel in disguise, you're an angel in disguise)
An angel, an angel
(An angel in disguise, you're an angel in disguise)
An angel, an angel
(An angel in disguise, you're an angel in disguise)
An angel, an angel
(An angel in disguise, you're an angel in disguise)
An angel, an angel
(An angel in disguise, you're an angel in disguise)
[Chorus]
But from what I know, you'll never go away
You don't ever leave my side, girl I'll die
But from what I know, you're always here to stay1Embed
