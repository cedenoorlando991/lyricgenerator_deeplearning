20 ContributorsSkyline Lyrics[Intro]
Do you know what makes this world go 'round?
Around

[Chorus]
Do you know what makes this world go 'round?
Around

[Verse]
Think it through
What it means to you
And everything you do
Don't affect just you, oh
I can't help but feel like I don't give a fuck
Might just take this shit and blow it up
It's no wonder I feel stuck
Fuck what set you bang, what hood you claim
We all come from the same
And I don't know if it'll change

[Chorus]
Do you know what makes this world go 'round?
Around
Do you know what makes this world go 'round?
AroundYou might also like2Embed
