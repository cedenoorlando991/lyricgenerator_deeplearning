19 ContributorsNo One Knows Lyrics[Verse 1]
You say you love me for me
It's hard to believe
I put my heart on my sleeve
You're all that I need

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't want to play your games no more
I changed for sure
And I'm balling on you
Watch me pull off in that foreign
Girl, don't come to my show
Who let you in the door?
No one knows
No one knows

[Chorus]
Oh, I bet
That you're missing me now
You know you wish
You were kissing me now
Oh, I bet
That you're missing me now
You know you wish
You were kissing me now
You might also like[Verse 2]
Girl, I loved you for you
I thought it was true
What should I do
You played me for a fool

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't want to play your games no more
I changed for sure
And I'm balling on you
Watch me pull off in that foreign
Girl don't come to my show
Who let you in the door?
No one knows
No one knows

[Chorus]
Oh, I bet
That you're missing me now
You know you wish
You were kissing me now
Oh, I bet
That you're missing me now
You know you wish
You were kissing me now
[Bridge]
But I don't want to play your games no more
I changed for sure
And I'm balling on you
Watch me pull off in that foreign
Girl, don't come to my show
Who let you in that door?
No one knows, no one knows
But I don't want to play your games no more
I changed for sure
And I'm balling on you
Watch me pull off in that foreign
Girl don't come to my show
Who let you in that door?

[Outro]
No one knows, no one knows
No one knows, no one knows (I don't know nobody)
No one knows, no one knows
No one knows (I don't, nobody)
No one knows, no one knows
No one knows (No one knows)
No one knows, no one knows
No one knows7Embed
