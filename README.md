Title: Generate lyrics for your favorite singer

Collaborators: Jarra Omar, Orlando Cedeno

Abstract: The goal of this project is to generate lyrics for a favorite singer of your choice. For our data, we used Genius's API to load artists and a collection of their songs into a csv file. From there, after some pre-processing of the text we were able to train a deep learning model to generate new lyrics based on the patterns and themes found in the existing lyrics.
