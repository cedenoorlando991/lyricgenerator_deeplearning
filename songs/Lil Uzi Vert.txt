Open your legs and I keep 'em closed
Livin' life on the edge, on a tightrope
I am so clean, I might start movin' soap (Yeah)
Drive a new 'Rari, I don't need a note (Skrrt)
Drive a Bugatti like it's a Volvo
I got your girl and you already know (Skrrt)
Don't really like her, we friends for the most
Cuban link tri-color, all on my choker (Skrrt)
Don't leave the crumb, got the bread, then you toast
If you start touchin' my gun, got no holst'
I put a coat on top of my coat
Only twenty minutes before the show (Show)

[Chorus]
I met that girl right up at my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town, never saw her before
Told her, "Baby, we don't got that long"
Listen, this not my city show, but, I treat it like my city show
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on
Twenty more minutes until I'm on, twenty more minutes until I'm on (Yeah)
I am not slow, these girls just want me, 'cause I got the dough
Pass that girl right on my friend, give and go (What?)
He pass me her friend, so they switchin' roles (Yeah)

Damn, I just started it (Started), man, I just started it
Oh my God, please, do not bother me
Don't got enough just to order me (Yeah)

On the weekend, you was partyin'

Jump in the Porsche, I might target it (Skrr)

I'm basically saying I'm cooler (Slatt)
Get Dior discounts from my cougar
Back in the sixth grade, I got them bad grades
I was in love with my tutor (Yeah)
See, musically, Lil Uzi trappin’, man
Most of you rappers be actors, man
Go M.I.A when I find little Madison
Stay at the Ritz-Carlton, this not the Radisson
Just took a blue one, ’bout to take the red pill
Purple thoughts in my brain, hope it don't spill
Stay with a nerd just like Urkel, Jaleel
Fresh just like Carlton, I kill ’em with Will
Big ass "R" on my Smiths
Big ass "R" on my whips
Slip-on shoes, so you won't trip
Said she kinda fine if she got some hips
Momma said, "Let me see the witch
Boy you know light and dark don't mix
Mix it up, boy, bad luck"
Sick to my stomach with them neon guts

Sanguine ParadiseSanguine Paradise Lyrics[Intro]
We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass (I'm working on dying), do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

[Verse 1]
If she left with me, she the right ho
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you could buy ho
But I bought a mansion with a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door
So you can hear her hit the high note
[Bridge]
I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Foreign girls and they 10s, I can't choose
Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise

[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin' and my doors suicide

[Verse 2]
Side note, you will never reach my goals (At all)
I be walkin' with a slime nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side ho
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon, so I feel like Michael
I was talkin' to my little slime, that's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality, I'm 5'4"
Stand on my money, now I'm 6'6"
Hit her once, now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister, make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aimin' at his top, boy you need a mop
Man, I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick

We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'

Now stay on your stomach, lil' bitch, when you lay down

So you know that's a must like Elon, mane

I remember when your ass was just swervin' me
Please keep that same energy with the urgency
I'm liftin' these big ol' stacks like my name Hercules
Bulletproof on my tank, that's my insurgency
These old niggas wan' rob me like a burglary (Let's go)
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
I can make your lil' bitch just wanna percolate
Sex first, then we can have a after-date (Free Uzi)
Gave me head 'til my shit, um, decapitate
Look me in my eye and do, um, that nasty face (Free Uzi)
Make it rain in the club, like a nasty day
Told 'em that I'm comin', oh, no ejaculate (Yeah)
Pastry, pocket, boy, you not havin' cake
Fuck that overcoat, and I swear your jacket late
Bro just made his money back off a half a plate
Rollie cost me forty thousand, that's half the face (Let's go)
I remember when them niggas all laughed at me
Portfolios, now they all bring they apps to me
Wish before me that my bitch practiced abstinence
Wishes don't come true until you just practice it
Niggas broke? Never, ho, bitch, we havin' it
Yes, we spendin' it, but you know we stackin' it

I got one girl from Philly, I think her name Nicki
And I fuck with Nicki 'cause she not too picky
And she not too choosy, but sometimes she bougie
I play with her kitty until it get sticky
I'm movin' the bitch just like an alien
Chop with a fifty, my Uzi Israeli
See, I turned to the boss, can't deal with no middleman
Anthony Davis, don't deal with the Pelicans (What?)
Straight out the mud, we got that work that turn you to the Grudge
Leave you slime like a snail, you get hit with these slugs
I say how I feel and I do what I want
And not just because it is what it was
I'm high like a bird, man, but don't got no Lugz
Know you heard what I said, got this shit out the mud
I'm not in these streets, I'm just close with the plug
I just saw his mother, I gave her a hug
[Verse 1]
If you talkin' 'bout the work, nigga, just hide that, supply that
Stuff a hundred rounds in the compact, contact
I probably fucked the bitch from your hometown projects
Opened up her mouth, put my dick all inside that
She don't get high, but she geeked off the contact
That's why I'll never, ever, ever keep in contact (Yeah)
Just closed case, so a nigga can't find that, baby, where your mind at?
Come here, girl, sign that, matter fact, oh, never mind then
Front door, find that after the climax
And she screamin' my name every time we behind it
When I heard the door, get up, baby, where my nine at?
Water on my neck, 3D like it's IMAX (Water)
Diamonds turned a bird to a goddamn blind bat
Ass so fat that I got to hit beside that
Heard a nigga put his Lamb' trucks on finance (Finance)
Woah (No, no, no), y'all niggas insane
No, we're not the same, I'm more like a big body (Skrrt), you like a Range

Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bah (I'm working on dying)

Got a bitch, yeah, she look so good
But on the real, she in denial
Diamond water, yeah, it look like a river
Look like I'm standing in the Nile
If you really didn't get the last line
Then your level on the brain of a child
Pay attention, better do the right thing
Or your pussy ass still workin' at Sal's

Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop that ass, pop that ass, do the dash
I be runnin' out of gas
Every time I go to the mall just to pop the tags
I don't really cop nothin' at the mall
First time at the mall, copped it all
Said, "A hundred thousand," so I dropped it all
And that wasn't my whole bankroll
Body roll, waist roll, waist roll
Make a bitch do what I say so
Waist trained, got a bitch, taste just like ice cream
Read her text, she said, "Girl, I scream"
Shot a nigga with a 17
Lil Uzi, yeah, I'm from the 16
Got a million, no Christine
Neck gleam, wrist gleam, fist gleam
Lil' nigga but I'm doin' big things
You ain't ever seen a nigga this clean
Pants cost two K, big jeans
And my shoes cost like sixteen
Hunnid, nigga, that's just what I bleed
Turned a dead nigga to a blunt of weed
And that last boy taste like Reggie

I been was planning to leave her (Ooh), so I just left it to Jesus
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, Lil Vert, like Gerald (Damn)
Told that girl to cheer up, fucking that girl 'til she tear up
Heard you fucked her, she embarrassed
Heard your whip Gary Barbara (Eww)
Wait, for real? For real? For real?
Diamonds, they wet like a seal, diamonds wet like Navy Seal
Heard you drink lean, crack the seal, everybody know, it ain't real

Won't say no names, but my niggas, they pulled up
You niggas talk too much, get your mouth sewed up (Yeah)
Look at my chain, throwing salt 'cause it's snowing
Vivienne West but my fur lookin' polar
My Gosha from Dover, I drive in the Rover
Homie don't know me, don't get in my moment
All that sneak dissing, don't think that I ain't noticed
I lift my door and I forgot to close it
Boy, better keep it sealed (Huh), fuck around, get killed (Yeah)
Fuck around, get drilled, cut your hands if you steal (Damn)
Whip it up like a meal, I just made me a mil' (Yup)
Money jumping out my pocket, tucking bands in my belt
Stop calling my phone, leave me alone
I'm on TV with the VVs so I 3-D'd my stones, yeah
