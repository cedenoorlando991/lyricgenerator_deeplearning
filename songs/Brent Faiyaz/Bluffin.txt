Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care (You could be bluffin' or I could mean nothin' at all)
Either there's somethin' or there's nothing there (Maybe there's nothing there)
Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care (You don't care)
Either there's somethin' or there's nothing there (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Lately I don't feel the same
I ain't your baby father, I ain't your one and only (You don't care)
But you love to scream my name (Nothing there)
And I done taught you things in exchange for constant pain (You don't care)
You led me on
On and on and on

[Chorus]
Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care (You could be bluffin' or I could mean nothin' at all)
Either there's somethin' or there's nothing there (Maybe there's nothing there)
Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care (You don't care)
Either there's somethin' or there's nothing there

[Verse 2]
All he do is beat you down
But you stick around (You don't care)
I bet he wouldn't be actin' so hard if I was there (Nothing there)
I know you get lonely and I know you don't know me (That well)
But that don't mean that this won't ever go nowhere
And I call your bluff
You might also like[Chorus]
Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care (You could be bluffin' or I could mean nothin' at all)
Either there's somethin' or there's nothing there (Maybe there's nothing there)
Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care (You don't care)
Either there's somethin' or there's nothing there

[Bridge]
Maybe you just don't care (You don't care)
Or there ain't nothin', nothin' there
Maybe you just don't care (You don't care)
Or there ain't nothin', nothin' there

[Chorus]
Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care (You could be bluffin' or I could mean nothin' at all)
Either there's somethin' or there's nothing there (Maybe there's nothing there)
Either you're bluffin' or you just don't care (You don't care)
Either there's somethin' or there's nothing there1Embed
