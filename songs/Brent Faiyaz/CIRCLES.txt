Forget who I am (did I?)
And how this goes? (did I?)
Did I forget who I am? (did I?)
And how this goes?

[Verse]
Only heaven knows
If you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end
How am I up right now? I'm not, I'm still down
Only heaven knows
If you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end
How am I up right now? I'm not, I'm still down
Niggas dying everyday, but what can I say?
They just want me to sing
It's like everyone wants you to think how they think
And do what they say and stay out the way
And if you don't wanna they got a problem with you

[Chorus]
Did I forget who I am?
And how this goes? (No way, now how)
Did I forget who I am? (Chasing gold?)

[Verse]
Only heaven knows
If you can truly win in the midst of a world that's gon' end
How am I up right now? I'm not, I'm still down
Niggas dying everyday, but what can I say?
They just want me to sing
It's like everyone wants you to think how they think
And do what they say and stay out the way
And if you don't wanna they got a problem with you

It’s so hard to realize
Things I put you through
It’s so hard to real life
Bring it back to blue
