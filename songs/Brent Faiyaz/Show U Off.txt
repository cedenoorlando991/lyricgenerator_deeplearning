I know you feelin' down 'bout how they treat you
Nobody understands all that you been through
And you just wanna get love the way you show love
It's hard to picture life being in your shoes
You ain't in touch with your baby father
You only gettin' older and it gets harder
He said he was in love, but wasn't on his job
You got your whole paycheck that says, "You'll get through"

[Chorus]
I don't wanna keep you down (Don't wanna keep you down)
A nigga wanna raise you up, yeah (Wanna raise you up)
And someone gotta take you out (Gotta take you out)
Someone's gotta show you off (Gotta show you off)

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna call you "baby"
And never make you feel small? (I'm here for you)
Who's gonna love you crazy?
I'm never gonna let you fall
I know you ain't lookin', but if you're lookin'
Then look no further
Because you're worth it, girl
I got all this love for you
'Cause you deserve it (Fuck 'em if they don't see)
You're Black and perfect
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't wanna keep you down, oh (Don't wanna keep you down)
A nigga wanna raise you up, yeah (Wanna raise you up)
And someone gotta take you out (Gotta take you out)
Somebody's gotta show you off, girl (Gotta show you off)

[Bridge]
I just wanna show you what the world don't (They do, they do)
I just wanna give you what the world won't (They won't, they won't)
Know that you will never have to feel alone, alone (Baby)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna keep you down (Don't wanna keep you down)
A nigga wanna raise you up, yeah (Wanna raise you up)
And someone gotta take you out, mm-mm (Gotta take you out)
Somebody's gotta show you off

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Oh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Oh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Oh)2Embed
