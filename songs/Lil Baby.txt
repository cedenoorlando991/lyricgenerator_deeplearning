FreestyleTranslationsTürkçeFreestyle Lyrics[Intro]
DaVinci (DaVinci, DaVinci)
Yeah
Shoutout the whole Oakland City, man
You know what I'm saying? The whole 4PF
Know what I'm saying? I put this up
Yeah

[Verse]
Shoutout my label, that's me
I'm in this bitch with TB
I'm in this bitch with 4 Trey
I just poured up me an eight
Real nigga all in my face
Five hundred racks in my safe
Five hundred racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love?
What you know 'bout pullin' up in Bentley trucks?
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no ho
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom, we used to wear each other's clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain’t my niggas no more
Hold it down for the four
In the nine with the woes
Marlo my dawg, that's for sure
We won't fall out about shit
'Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain't gon' fall out 'bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both of my ears on froze
I been gettin' faded, I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck, I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties, I pay for 'em
Get outta that when I wake up
I pass the ball, I don't layup
I'm a big boss, I got say so
They'll wipe you down if I say so
Dracos on Dracos on Dracos on Dracos
.40s on .40s on .40s
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina, shoutout New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint, change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz truck
Hop out fresher than a menthol
Lil' nigga, but I'm big, dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Get a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talkin' 'bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones, don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer, don't push me
I see how you niggas be lurkin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a Vert with an Uzi
12 get behind me, I lose 'em
They tryna guess what I'm doin'
They tryna guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits

Close FriendsTranslationsРусскийPortuguêsClose Friends Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you
[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in

Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

On MeOn Me Lyrics[Intro]
(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

[Verse 1]
Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong
[Chorus]
I'm like, "Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me"
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

[Verse 2]
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

[Chorus]
I'm like, "Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me"
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip

The Bigger PictureTranslationsTürkçeEnglishThe Bigger Picture Lyrics[Intro]
Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

[Verse 3]
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life

But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here

Emotionally ScarredTranslationsРусскийPortuguêsEmotionally Scarred Lyrics[Verse 1]
A love letter came through the mail, it said, "I miss you"
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, "Of course"
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah
[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

WoahTranslationsPortuguêsWoah Lyrics[Intro]
New car very noisy
Come through and it's roarin'
Yeah, yeah
You know how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming

[Verse 1]
Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
"Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses"
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, "What's happenin'?"
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper
[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it, woah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless
If you tell 'em what was said, you a rodent
Drive the new Corvette like it's stolen, yeah

Sum 2 ProveTranslationsPortuguêsSum 2 Prove Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know Lil Ced, that's my nigga, I made him a millionaire, fuck it, we all rich
I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we fuck with the rubber, but I got a raw bitch
Know this money bring envy, you probably wan' be me, but bro, we can't beef 'bout no small shit
Overseas, got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
Businessman, went and got me an office
Million-dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' on Sparks Street
Hot lil' jit, he gon' stay with the chopstick
I got robbed, that shit made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sister, my mamas
Now they houses as big as they want 'em
I done ran up them motherfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique
Livin' like we in a race, I might come in first or second, but I won't ever be last
Lately, I been in my bag
Bro told me don't take my foot off the gas
If they give you a inch, go'n and take you a mile
I'ma shoot by myself like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, "I can't"
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you, I run with them snakes
Peep all the moves I been makin', by time I get forty, I gotta be one of them greats
Watch how I move with this paper, I know if I slip up one time they gon' try to come take it
Real as it get and these niggas be fakin', I don't want they vibes, so they hand I ain't shakin'
She on that '42 straight with no chaser
I'm tryna get out of here and go taste her, yeah

I got rich, they need money, they askin' me
I was sittin' in jail, they ain't look out for me
Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me
I been handlin' my own, they can vouch for me
Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be
I done gave her the world, now she not leavin'
Say she love me to death, told her, "Stop breathin'"
He try do what I do, but we not even
I want all of the beef, I am not vegan
Boy, you said it was smoke, nigga, stop speakin'
'Ventador, drop the top, I can't stop speedin'
Tryna see if this bitch hit the top speed
Hit the bitch from the back, have her knock knee
Call me Baby Hov, I control the rock
If the rap slow, I control the block
Yeah, I'm really it, and you niggas not
Got a couple coupes, I can drop the top
I done made it, nigga, all these digits comin' in

But I had to go coupe, no brain (Coupe, no brain)
Ain't worried 'bout you, I'ma do what I do

Bought her brand new shoes, told her kick rocks
Don't stand too close, diamonds kickbox
Think red means go so I don't stop
I know they wish they could catch me, but keep wishin'
You think I done turned into a fiend for these bitches
Tryna stuff as much as I can in these britches
Made your bitch fuck on my friend, it's no difference
I ain't never popped no Xan, I sip sizzurp
If I ever have to tell on the gang, I won't do it
If I put it on a song, I seen it or been through it
I can't put it in my song, I know how the feds move
Scream free all of the ahks but I ain't no FamGoon
Gave my mama ten bands, sent her to Cancún
Got the crowd goin' dumb but I ain't no damn fool
If I went in there and did it and made it, you can too
We done came a long way from broke and sharing shoes

Got a quarter million dollars in a book bag
New Era, I'm a dope boy, no cap
I'm living my best life for real
Just left the dealership, no tag
If we opposite, it won't work, it won't last
Get an opposite knocked off, toe tag
Ain't been home in a month, got my ho mad
They need me in the trap but I can't go back
I jumped off the porch with a hundred dollar slab
I got M's in the bank, give a damn what they think
Every vibe I ever shot my shot at, caught it
Everything you ever seen me riding in, bought it
Big dawg status, I ain't gotta sell drugs
Put my craft into rap then I took off, yeah
New G-Wagen, no key, this a push-start
I can hit the gas, make it disappear

Yeah, yeah
We ain't talked in like a week straight
I been all on the interstate
I been tryna go and get this cake
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
She in her feelings because we ain’t speaking, but she don’t even call a nigga
She gon' get nasty whenever I see her, she tryna suck all them niggas
Heard you been doing business with the opps, fuck you and all them niggas
We gon' keep riding around with them Glocks until we find them niggas
[Verse 1]
They thinkin' I lost it, remind them niggas
I can get flyer than niggas
Hundred thousand in a Gucci bookbag, they thinkin' I signed a nigga
I leveled my life up, this Rollie I got on don't tick tock
Still on that bullshit, if you pull up on me, let the stick talk
I'm in L.A. with the vibes, they in the cut getting high
She tryna get in my ride, she tryna turn up tonight, yeah
I was running up cash, yeah, I had ran up a bag
And they started gettin' mad, yeah
But I didn't get mad, I just kept getting cash, yeah
Now I'm in my bag, yeah, now I'm in my bag, yeah
She wanna get with me, she know that I'm sticky, but I'm in my bag now
She wasn't fucking with me, she didn't come around, she wishing she had now
And I'm in my bag now
I'm in the bag, the Goyard to be exact
Three hundred racks inside it, and that ain't no cap
I could've bought a Wraith today, yeah yeah
I ran it up, they supposed to hate
I'm digging this lifestyle
Water drippin' on me like I'm a faucet
The crew with me right now
You can play, just proceed with caution
I popped the wrong pill, now I'm nauseous
I need to get off this drank, it's a problem
I took a Tesla and landed on Mars​
Lord please wake me up tomorrow

Diamonds on Fiji, I'm running with QC
And Reebok endorse me, went up a new level
I'm loving this lifestyle and niggas wanna be me
I know they won't catch up, but I ain't gon' let 'em
As soon as the money get up to a million, put it in the ground and then go buy a new shovel
How you gon' be in yo feelings when I'm in my feelings?
We both can't be in our feelings
I ain't gon' lie when you thinkin' I did it, I did it
It's something 'bout your intuition
Ain't telling you no lies, I'm tired of seeing you cry
Come here girl, let me wipe your eye

Big body Benz, 'member I used to be dusty
Now I want my money all hundreds in a rush please
I was sellin' weed when they came out with White T
Now I put a whole half a ticket on my white tee
Whole hood poppin', other niggas, they don't like me
Made her eat it up, she told her friend, "He gon' wife me"
All my niggas thoroughbred, I don't fuck with crossbreeds
Free all of the bros down the road and on Rice Street

Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
How we get so deep so fast?
Bae, stop playin', I'll beat your ass
You be on some toxic shit but I cannot get off this bitch, I
Haven't seen you in three months, I miss you, can I see you, bae?
Every time I see one of your pictures, that shit drives me crazy
Girl, I know you miss a nigga
Especially how I kiss it
Message say delivered
Why the fuck you keep goin' missing on me?
Every time he get back in the picture, you act different on me
Ayy, tell that nigga we gon' have to share you, I ain't trippin' on it
One more time might be the best for both of us
Maybe we should talk about it later when we sober up
Maybe we should keep it goin', maybe we should let it go
Feel like if it's meant it's what it is so just let it flow
Got somethin' to handle so I'ma be here for a couple hours
Figured out you like them, my assistant keep on sendin' flowers
They got they own business, tell me why the fuck they all in ours?
Mama raised a lot of things but she ain't raised no fuckin' coward
We went to the moon last time, I'm tryna go back
We been doin' our thing for a while but they don't know that
I be buyin' you all type of bags but you can't show that
I be playin' the cut until you come back
[Chorus: Fridayy]
I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?
I'm in your city
'Cause I need it one more time
Might lose it all, I swear
I need it tonight, ooh, ah

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Thinkin' how we played out
Really I feel off about it but ain't never said it
We ain't gotta talk about it
They'll never know when I'm with you, I play a different role
Can't move off emotion, this shit deep now I got self-control
I ain't never tried to hold you, niggas try to high and low me
I can break it down in dumbest terms and show you how you owe me
Still try and back door me, I know how to go about it
I know everything but I treat you like I don't know about it
Wildin' in Skyami, we took shrooms and caught a different vibe
Bitches can't fuck with you, you the one, for real, I peep your style
I gotta get to it, I'm OT so it's gon' be a while
It feel a lil' better when I ain't seen you, yeah

[Chorus: Fridayy]
I know you miss me
Who it's gon' be if it ain't me, lil' baby?

(Tay Keith, this too hard)
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I paid some extra before we even come out
And don't even wear it to show I ain't playin'
I hit the bitch and I gave her some racks
And I pull up my pants, she know I ain't stayin'
Go on a store run and get rubber bands
I done got rich, I done put on my mans
Choppers in traffic, that's just how I'm livin'
They say that I'm trippin', they wouldn't understand
She take a trip, she come back with a tan
I take a trip, I come back with them bands
When I was dealin', it really was killin' 'em
Had 'em competin', tryna see what I'm payin'
She throw a hoodie on soon as we land
She don't like pics, I got too many fans
I'm runnin' shit, I can do what I want
And it's really a limit, you do what you can
I found the booth and I put that shit up
'Fore I run out of cash, they gonna run out of land
I fell in love with this bitch 'cause her head was amazing
I swear I don't even know her name
I'm 'bout to takeoff, I gave 'em a chance
They gave me ten M&M's on advance
Thought I'd be trappin' forever, but God came and blessed me
I guess it was part of the plan
How he on fire, but he cool as a fan?
Can't get at you, we gon' get at your man
They can relate to me 'cause I be poppin' it
Put in they face, let 'em see what I'm sayin'
I'm rockin' shows like I play with a band
Free all the bros, know I would if I can
If I don't mean it, I swear I ain't sayin' it
'Fore I was 21, swear I was savage, smashin'
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
We got FN with extensions, we throwin' that
Her ass got my full attention, she throwin' that
Niggas talkin' way too much, I ain't goin' back
And forth with niggas 'cause these niggas be holdin' racks
On the real, yeah, we know you don't own them racks
Four pockets full, push 'em down, they start pokin' back
I turned eight million right until I'm a quarterback
Spent a million like I'm tryna bring Kobe back (24, woo)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I use the crockpot like it's Betty
They say the drop hot and it's ready
Might stretch it out, but it ain't fetti (Yes)
Say my dawg doin' time
But I know he ain't gonna snitch 'cause it's still some shit he didn't tell me
My dawg stabbed his celly
He told me the whole story over the celly (Brr, hello?)
Went up on my price, in my pocket like Kelly
Fucked her in the telly, no I can't not say who, no telly
My head gettin' heavy
And you know I still got Balmains on my ass (Woo)
No, I can't do no Amiris
Said I'm takin' trips, long flights, they scary
She said her birthday in March, okay, cool, so that means you an Aries
I told her, "Gotta go," she said, "You serious?"
Diamonds cold as December, my vibe Sagittarius

Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I can switch up and come back another way
If the vibe ain't right, come back another day
Biggest dripper, I start up a tidal wave
Remix weed, we put it in a microwave
Batch for twenty-three like I know Michael J
He can say what he want, but he gotta pay
Used to hide all the guns where my mama stay
Sell my drugs 'round the corner
I pay all these bills, I'm a grownup
My cars a lil' different, I own 'em
I ain't with no leasin', my bitch tellin' me I need credit
It's loud and clear if I said it
I come from the gutter, I spent me a hundred on Chevys
You can take me out the hood, but you can't take the hood out of me
Know the hood proud of me
I Givenchyed my tee, went and upgrade my teeth
Yeah, I dropped out of school, but that paper on me
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?27Embed

[Chorus]
Toast to 'em all
She said she love me but I know the truth, she been fuckin' my dawg (my dawg and all)
Lately I been feelin' crazy so I ain't been answerin' calls
I just been gettin' the money and savin' it
Keepin' my back on the wall

Straight to the money no stop
I'ma go straight to the stars
Free all of my niggas sittin' in the cell blocks
I'ma give it all I got
I'ma go straight to the stars
Condo at the top floor
We was so high, you can ask God
You can ask God
[Verse 1]
I know they hate it, I see they faces, they mad I made it
I'm on they ass, I'm gettin' this bag, I ran it up fast
Stand up in they chest no apology
Mama sent a text that she proud of me
Youngins in the hood watchin' out for me
Money all colors like Monopoly
Park the Jeep, hop in the Vet
Stay on they ass, stay on they neck
Keep me a check
Viper came yellow, I painted it red
And I paid cash, you heard what I said
Goin' crazy, I been feelin' the rage
Last year I was sittin' in the cage
This year I'm goin' all the way
Taking drugs, tryna ease the pain
I see 'em watchin'
They on my drip, they tryna follow the wave
They on my page
They know that I'm paid, ain't been in town in days
Most of these niggas they old news
All these bitches been ran through
I'ma save all the fifties and keep the hundreds
Then spend all the dubs on getting money
Straight from the 'jects to a jet
We been gettin' real fly
Free G-Five, on a G5
Balmain denim, no Levis
Strapped to a T, who want war with us
Dually sit up like an armored truck
I brought it out, it's a one of one
Nigga screaming gang, they ain't one of us

Draped down in Gucci, she rock Givenchy, she matchin' my fly

Let's take a trip, if we leave now, we can land tonight
We gon' take a trip to Dubai, guarantee you won't see nobody
Nobody safe where I come from
Young niggas goin' straight dumb
Fifty hollow tips in each drum
Throwing fours up with lil one
Hoppin' out trucks, we suited up, we ready for war, yeah
Yeah that's my boy, that's really my dawg
We went from boys to men

We gon' pull up where your mama at
Runnin' through hoes like a running back

TimeTime Lyrics[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Youngin from the project fucked around and got it poppin
I'm like fuck a Maserati, bought my bitch a Bentley truck
G-5 my blood brother he be throwing B’s up
And me, I got Chanel swag, you know I be C'd up
I paid cash for every car, used be the laughing stock
Kept it real, that's why I don't flock
Look at me, I'm on the chart
I don't look down but I'm on top
I don't entertain any clout
Play with me, you gon' get shot for real
Now they can't resist us, hear 'em tryna diss us
Really need to miss us, prolly with your bitch, bruh
I bought her purse off a piece of my endorsement
Richer than my classmates, she know how my kids taste
Now I'm on this cash race, I can't come in last place
I done finally went legit, accountants, I'm a taxpayer
So you know that mean I'm goin' hard 'til my last day
Still can get a thousand pounds a week, the gas way
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I’m goin' all out if it's 'bout mine
I’m gettin' my shine on, I been on my grind
Feel like I'm different, I'm one of a kind
Buy her a Birkin Bag, keep her up to par
Baby, you look better naked, you should take it off
Had to play my role, now I'm takin' charge
Just got off parole, made the brodie take the charge

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Bendin' through in that Phantom with them sticks, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
All these blues, niggas asking am I Crip yet? (Cuzzo)
Make a move we X you out, ain't goin' tic tac (Brrt)
Put a tag on your toe for all that chit chat (Yeah, yeah)
The richest nigga in my city, that's a big fact (Big fact)
And we don't do them lil' planes, we on the big jet (Big jet)
My dawg still movin' that 'caine, and he ain't quit yet (He ain't quit yet)
I had to tell him when he came, "Don't bring no bricks back"
Feel like I'm the chosen one (Woah)
Rolls truck, I ordered one (Woah)
I ain't mean to buy that bitch a watch, but I bought her one (Ah)
Richard Millie cost a quarter milli', I got more than one (Yeah)
FN on me lighter than a bitch, feel like a water gun (Gang)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]

In A MinuteTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsIn A Minute Lyrics[Intro]
(Damn, Kai, you goin' crazy)

[Verse 1]
I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, "Baby keep it solid"
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, "Lay low"
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco
[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

[Verse 2]
Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, "Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, "Don't tell hoes where you stay at"
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

(Cook that shit up, Quay)

[Verse 1]
My mama been told me don't give no poor performance
And whatever you gon' do, just do it
Never thought 'bout doin' music
I was tryna build my phone up
Contacts full of drug abusers
Ridin' around with that Mexican, tryna figure out what my cousin doin'
Prison with the 'migos, found out they was sellin' bricks
Wish I would've knew that shit, I would've been lit
Swear to God, since I was seventeen, I been hood rich
I be at James Harden house, I'm all in Houston in the mix
I'm talkin' 'bout spare time in New York, I buy floor seats to watch the Knicks
And I don't even know no players
I just wan' show off my new drip and put my chains in layers
I might just stand up and go crazy, someone make the layup
And we ain't squashin' shit for free, you niggas gotta pay us
You niggas better pay up, yeah
Know he might not beat it, I told the lawyer go for a lighter sentence
I don't want know no problems with y'all niggas, y'all got women tendencies
I don't gotta sell drugs no more, I'm bossed up, I got plenty business
Ridin' 'round in that Lam' truck, I wreck this bitch, it ain't rented
Givin' out my respect, get respect in every city
Niggas know I came up, but I came back through the slums with Diddy
Fucked around and got plugged in, I'm buyin' that red Richard Mille
Stay out my lil' brother business, just know that they gettin' millions
[Chorus]
Press the button right there to let the doors in
Go hard all year, I don't care, I'm goin' all in
This house, vibes everywhere, she callin' more friends
My word or nothin', I ain't lyin', I cannot bargain

[Verse 2]
Sippin' wockiana, come here, thotiana
Let me bust you down, ah, yeah, yeah
What kinda watch you wanted?
Man, that's nothin', mami
I'm not bein' funny, yeah, yeah, yeah
I should've knew you was gon' rat the day you told me
A hundred racks in all dubs, it ain't no foldin' me
I ain't no puppet, I ain't with nobody controllin' me
I go LeBron when it's crunch time, it ain't no holdin' me
You got the Maybach, Benz truck, I'm tryna buy one
I told lil' shawty just let bygones be bygones
Tell the feds get off my dick, I don't gotta buy guns
They got the right one, yeah

[Chorus]
Press the button right there to let the doors in
Go hard all year, I don't care, I'm goin' all in

Put baguettes in my AP, I ain't on playin' about they beef
Niggas know I play for keeps, treat my brothers like they me
Had to make myself a boss, it ain't no nigga workin' me
I invest a couple mil' and let my money work for me
Know they hate the way it happened, probably somewhere cursin' me
I don’t know nothing ’bout no killin', all I know is murder beats
I got rich and understand my next three cars gon’ be a lease
I ain't never losin' sleep about no beef, I roll in peace
I put diamonds in my teeth, came from grindin' in the streets
Get a load and break it down and sell it all and then repeat it
Pray to God for all the dawgs behind the wall, they need they freedom (Free y’all)
When I be on TV and perform, I hope they see me (See me)
Once it's up, it's stuck, we get over on niggas, not get even
Forgiato rims on my dually, I ride diesel
Only rock Amiris with my team, not no Diesel
Got some niggas up in Philly play with birds like they Eagles
She keep sayin' I'm the man, that shit boostin' up my ego
Still in Atlanta sellin' bags like they legal, I'm just sayin' (Yeah)
[Chorus]
How you try to run off with the wave and you ain't surfin'?
Gave 'em all the drip, them niggas still acted thirsty
I ain't even counted up to see what I'm worth yet
All I know is put it up and keep on workin'
I can't even hold you, I been gettin' loaded
Devil on my shoulders
God got my back, so I keep on rollin', yeah

[Verse 2]
Drop-top McLaren (Oh), everybody starin' (Lookin')
Lil' one from the hood turned into the man (Big dawg)
Get a lot of money (Yeah), try to stuff it in my pants (4 Pockets)
I might do the woah (Woah), nigga, I don't dance
Rings on my hand cost a fortune
Shout out to my mama, no abortion (What's up?)
D-Boy, white Air Forces (Crisp)
Different kinda bags, I got choices (Flavors)
And I got the swag for a loyal ticket
Think I'm hearin' voices in my head sayin', "Kill him" (Kill him)
Know she'll forgive me, I'm one of the real ones
Really from the trenches, turn a dollar to a nickel (Get 'em)
Baddest of the baddest, guess I gotta wait to pick 'em
Try us, then we smashin', then they go to playin' victim (Kill 'em)
I don't know what happened, all I know is he got hit up
I'ma need a napkin, chains drippin', VV's lit up
I'ma get the money and go hard long as I get up (Get up)
We gon' beat the trial, I told lil' bruh to do some sit-ups (Push-up)
Win, win, win, no lose or draw, I never give up (Nah)
Nigga, what you bangin'? What you claimin'? Throw that shit up (4, Baby)

HeyyTranslationsPortuguêsEspañolHeyy Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
My favorite bitch just cut me off and she won't even let me know the reason (Yeah)
It's probably one of her lil' messy hatin'-ass friends bein' evil
I ain't stressin' 'bout it, she'll come around when she wanna eat it up
Slow stroke, fast stroke, grindin' it, I'm a real pleaser
Sixty hoes in New York havin' dinner
Bottega send it to me soon as they get it
I put Maybach seats in the Sprinter
Make sure evеrybody sit comfortable
You gotta really pay attention, I'm not mumblin'
Shе tryna have a good time, she wanna come with us
They know we can't be fucked with, they not one of us
It's done been some times I slipped, I'm not fallin'
Brabus baby blue, the inside too, I'm feelin' like a kid again
They thought I got lucky last time, fuck it, I'm back on that shit again
Her last bag was a crocodile Kelly
Got it chocolate to match her skin
I just gave bro a hundred pounds of wham
Told him, "Tell the city it's in"
Majority of the time, I "Hi" and "Bye," these niggas
I ain't with all that lockin' in shit
Money over everything, try to stop it
You get popped right then and there
Message thread full of, "Where you ats?" and "Pull up on me"
Bunch of whens and wheres
Youngins out here wildin' with no guidance
All they care about is who they kill
I was tryna keep that shit in order
It got harder 'cause I'm never there
It's a better life out here
I promise, brodie, I'ma keep it in they ear
I know how it feel to spin a opp
But it feel way better to count a million
I come from the bottom of the bottom
I shot right up through the fuckin' ceilin'
[Chorus]
Hey (Hey-hey-hey)
Everybody lit, can't put our fire out (Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey)
Hey (Hey-hey-hey)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, stay down, hustle hard until you come up
Take some, only when you need it
You won't make it far bein' greedy
My grandma taught me how to be a leader
If we fly commercial, we got greeters
They just know that we important people
They see how we comin', think we ghetto
Until they children tell 'em I'm their hero
Flight attendant said I look familiar
Crack a smile, tell her, "It's a small world"
Oh, that's your bitch? That's my ho too
We gon' share her, call her, "Our girl"
Real street music, I ran that field
If you can hit that, then she ain't my girl
Get your lick back, come step in my world
Two bitches on the same itinerary
The same flight, same hotel, they don't even know each other yet (Yeah)
One of 'em don't say nothin', the other askin', "Do we go together yet?"
Young turnt nigga, ain't no holdin' back
This a Brabus, bro, not a regular wagon
I don't kiss and tell, I ain't into that
I don't think I met a nigga colder yet, like

Once I hit it one time I ain't goin' back

Cook that shit up, Quay
4 Pockets Full, nigga

[Chorus]
Is you mad?
'Cause I'm getting cash
That ain't my place
Bought a new Wraith
She in my face
I want her head
I want her legs
I want a redhead
I want her head
I want her neck
I want her legs
You don't even beg
We can fuck on the floor
We can fuck in the shower
Leave your friends at the door
Tell 'em give you a hour
[Verse 1]
And they know I'ma GOAT
I got paper and power
Man, these niggas some hoes
Everything they say sour
I bought a Bentley and blew out her brain
Since I got money and people done changed
I'm keepin' my .40, I'm up on my aim
Jump out of line, I bust at your brain
Shoebox money, it ain't nothin' to me
I could make a hunnid in my sleep
These niggas cappin', that's all they see
They just wanna be like me
Takin' this swag and then give it back
I didn't get mad, I went and got more
They just wanna be like him
I don't wanna be like them
Used to wanna be like him
'Til I stayed down and ran up an M
Baby ballin', they should put it on film
Shootin' for bricks, I don't aim for the rim
Fuck the gym, I don't work out
Take a sip of the lean, wash the Perc down
I got on all my jewels, foreign, and all my shoes
These niggas mad 'cause I won't lose
I gotta win, I just began
No fake love, no fake friends
Just 30 in this FN

Pop me a Addi, a Percocet, pour me a four
Baby, we grown, we could fuck on the floor
I'm gettin' money
That's why they mad
That ain't my fault
Nigga, I'm a boss
Get white chalked
Playin' with an OG
I got bags
These niggas owe me, they know me
Standin' in the kitchen and workin' my wrists
I made a duece, turned to a nick
I make a nick, turned to a nine
I made  a nine, turned to a split
You know the rest, I made a split, turned to a brick
We in this bitch, we got it lit
We got them sticks

Who made this beat?

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
If I sell my soul, I'll take it back, I'm slime forever (Gimme that)
I put bust down on the whole gang, we gon' shine together
She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step out, she be flashin'
Whenever we get alone, I give her half and she get nasty
My jeans is special edition, Amiri send me these pants
And now everybody be tough, is he gangster or he just actin'?
Ain't got no card, don't do no fraud, seem like all of my bitches plastic
Know you niggas don't want smoke, let's see who run it up the fastest
Keep that fire when I'm cold, I can't let them catch me lackin'
I don't know if they think I'm sweet because I'm rappin'
But fuck 'em, we get active (Get active)
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Wrap it, make sure they can't smell it
Drive too far? Don't matter, I'll mail it
Tryna steal swag, I see it, I smell it
Used to get mad, probably beat up my celly
Now I sell bags every day in my city
Ain't doin' no playin', when they come, be ready
I got murder on my mind like that lil' nigga Melly (Free Melly)
Big boy rocks, stud the same size as Nelly (Ten karats)
Long as I live, I'ma get this cheddar
Ever since the bitch left, doin' lil' better
Which car I'ma drive? It depends on the weather
Rolls Royce truck pull up like, "Hello"
Pretty, tall, light skin, shake like Jell-O
If the bitch actin' bougie, I'ma take her to the ghetto
If I ain't smokin' Runtz, then it's probably Limoncello
You got a lil' boy, but you not on my level
Sell P's every day in the hood on my schedule
Young nigga give a ho whole groove like Stella
Jam don't shake like that, that's Jell-O
Made a whole M on the road, then lay low
I'm a real boss in my hood, I got say-so
I was havin' choppas 'fore I heard about Dracos
Put me in the casket with a bust down halo, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
If I sell my soul, I'll take it back, I'm slime forever (Give me that)
I put bust down on the whole gang, we gon' shine together
She got Rollies on her timepiece when she step by, she be flashin'

[Chorus]
Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that shit look good like right on

Ain't puttin’ no cap inside my rap, ain't too much leadin' you on

Everybody in a supercharger, I know we getting away
She want me to cum inside of who, I nutted in her face

Get a hotel for a year straight, ain't no pillow where I stay
I know bitches who set niggas up, yeah
I know niggas who whack bitches too, yeah
I been in a hundred million movies
Life is real, let her pop a pill, she enjoyed herself
Bad bitches, put 'em in the ring, they go below the belt
No referee, ain't no stoppin’ me, I’m tryna take it there
The only problems I'm havin’ in life is which watch I'ma wear
I grew up on that take it shit, I don't know how to steal
I ain't with all that fakin’ shit, I'd rather keep it real
You mad at me about a bitch who fucking both of us
I went and ran my money up, I swear it's over for 'em
I done gave my feelings up, I don't know who to trust
Shit comin' up missin' at the spot, I don't know who to bust
She my gangster bitch, I gave her racks and told her, "Stash that"
Love it when you throw it back like, damn, you know that ass fat
You know I'ma blast back, you know I'm way past that
So why you acting like it's something that it wasn't?
She know how to make me mad, I swear this bitch push every button
I know how to run up cash, I swear I'm gettin' hella money
Real spill

Slide my Rolls-Royce through the hood, that shit look good like right on

Bae, don't put me on your camera, you know what I look like
She like, "Put it in me raw," I asked her like, "What I look like?"
Bae, just call me when you get here, you know I don't book flights
We can't pop out, it won't even look right
I just hit the woman of my dreams with another bitch
I done scratched ten million off my bucket list
I'm never on no sucker shit
My city stand behind me, that's why I love this shit
Buildin' up for my kids' kids' kids, I ain't gon' never quit
Investin' my money in all type of shit, ownership
Please don't involve me in all that messy shit, I don't want the bitch
I put twenty-sixes on my Cullinan, that country shit
Buildin' up my audience, I'm all in other countries with it
Maxin' out my debit cards in one store
Take a pretty girl and give her what she want, I'm just having fun
Catch me cuttin' up in that ZR1, it's the fast kind

Money ForeverMoney Forever Lyrics[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I had to spread my wings, jump out my nest
Ran out of Act so I'm pourin' up red
I took the harder way like I'm Derez
Shout out the doctor keep givin' these meds
I got the streets in a lock like some dreads
Ride on the back of that bitch like some pegs
Runnin' this shit, they should cut off my legs
Had to play a little smarter, I'm using my head
Dropped out of school, took the street way instead
I'm a lil' dope boy, I want me some bread
I'ma shoot at your body, won't aim for your neck
I just cashed out on a flooded Patek
It ain't a big one, but dammit, it's big enough
I just came home from the can, I'ma live it up
I rep the gang, when you see me, I'ma throw it up
I just spent three hundred racks on a Bentley truck
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

[Verse 2: Lil Baby & Gunna]
Gotta maintain, can't go back broke
Gotta stand tall, won't bend or fold
Drop top 'Vette, tryna keep it in a Rolls
Ain't signin' no deal, ain't sellin' my soul
Gotta run it up fast, my mama gettin' old
I'm a million dollar nigga, gotta reach my goal
Got the hood on my back, still throwin' up fours
They say the Act gettin' low, I'm still pourin' up fours
I pour the six if it cost me
I like to fuck on your ho on the balcony
I got the cheese and I got me some broccoli
All color money, this shit like monopoly
Can't get this drip, ain't no need for you watchin' me
I ran my racks up and I moved out of poverty
I'm keepin' designer all over my body
I got some Buscemi, I got new Givenchy
Damn, I thought I'd never see the day
I'm so glad I made it through the rain
They don't wanna see a nigga straight
They don't wanna see young Gunna paid
Take a long time, I had to wait
Want this penthouse, a lot of space
A lot of hundreds comin' our way
Bust it down, split it with the gang
You might also like[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I used to sleep on the floor for a mattress
Getting evicted, that shit was embarrassing
My mama didn't have it, we made us a palettes
I had to share with the roaches and rats
Keep gettin' money these voices keep telling me
I went to prison, it made me a better me
I can't get no job, I got too many felonies
I been on probation since I was like seventeen
I done got me some stripes in the hood like a referee
I used to walk into school with that fire on me
I'm gettin' money, ain't really got time to beef
I don't know why these lil' bitches be lyin' on me
I'm the jungle for real where them lions be
I'm goin' apeshit, they callin' me Willie B
These niggas be sayin' they gon' rob me but we'll see
I'm gon' make every nigga with 'em fear me
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Screamin' out, "gang, gang, gang, gang, gang"
I do this shit for the gang
I didn't get in this for fame
Nigga ain't takin' my chain
I'ma stand firm with my name
They say you get money, you change
I got the money and stayed the same
I'm tryna stay in my lane

HumbleHumble Lyrics[Intro: Lori Perry & Lil Baby]
Day after day
Seems like I push against the clouds
(Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
They just keep blocking out the sun
It seems since I was born
I've wakened every blessed morning
I been thinkin' to myself lately
Wonderin' did she mean it when she say she hate me?
Or wonderin' did she mean it when she say she wished she didn't keep the baby? (Down on my luck and up against the wind)
[Verse 1]
Told Solid to speed it up, you ain't driving Miss Daisy
Rolls Royce truck plus, yeah, you driving Lil Baby
Hit from the back and grab her neck, it be drivin' her crazy
Ain't work no job since we met, I'm the reason she lazy
I got some checks that I ain't touch, they for Loyal and Jason
Really wanna have a daughter just so I can spoil her
Maybe look at women different
Father God, forgive me, I'ma been sinning for a minute
We bought sticks when it was tension
Fuck that bitch, she want attention
She get famous if I mention
I ain't gon' say her name at all
I was just sittin' in prison, damn near livin' like a dog
I remember that shit vividly, I do this shit for y'all
I'm not lookin' for no sympathy, won't cry about no loss
I got demons all on my back and arms, I'm tryna shake 'em off
I can't never fuck with lil' Mill again, he tried to take me off
I can't lie, you was my dawg, I heard that shit, it broke my heart
Can't no nigga say I did somethin' flawed, been solid from the start
Every situation ever happened, Baby played his part
I ain't never did shit to brag about it, I do that shit with honors
In my bag, but I been layin' back, I'm turnin' up this summer
Guess you mad 'cause I've been havin', tellin' hoes I was a runner
If I was, I was the richest runner in Georgia, on my mama
And I ain't never been no worker, had my own number, ask bruh
Seven summers straight we went crazy, called it good luck
You might also like[Chorus]
I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble
I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble, yeah

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' 'bout that shit you said, I can't get it out my head
I know that my heart is black, so all my cars' insides is red
I don't wanna argue with no one, let's get this guap instead
I ain't tryna beef with none these niggas 'cause all my opps is dead
If you ever run into police, you better not tell
Turn it up, I might as well, you know I'm so 4PF
'Fore I go, I gotta say what's up to all the bros in jail
I know that they be listenin', I know that he'll be with me
And his lawyer cost one-sixty, I hope they un-convict him when he go back
Follow him with a low jack, then step on him like a doormat
Doin' dirt, can't go back, my mind straight, ain't no slackin'
Guns all in Renee house, you ain't from the hood if you don't know Madison
[Chorus]
I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble
I been keepin' my distance, I switched up my number
I done made all these millions, I'm keepin' my hunger
All this food in a big house, my stomach still rumble
Got the ball, I won't fumble
I just touch down, stay humble, yeah7Embed

FrozenFrozen Lyrics[Intro]
Can someone come unthaw my heart? I think it's frozen

[Verse 1]
How you bring a knife to a gunfight?
They gon' always do it twice when it's done right
I remember ridin' 'round 'til the sunlight come up
I ain't tryna argue so I hung up
D-boy fresh with it on me, know how I pop out
If bullshit is not important, what I'm gon' lie 'bout?
Don't play with Baby, I give you somethin' to cry 'bout
That's a dime, that's for you and four of your friends to fly out
Every time we outside, that shit be goin' up
I got women tryna get at me like you been growin' up
Really, I know you see what's happenin', I'm steady blowin' up
I know niggas want me to fall but I'm steady goin' uphill
Started from the bottom, how the fuck I'm up here?
If you rеally came from nothin', then you know how that feel
Ain't no extras, only stеppers, that's the way that I live
Put some extras on it, blessed it, nigga, that's what I did
Heart cold frozen, got my mindset on where on however this shit go
Still kinda nervous hopin' nobody would notice it
At the point, I met you, slowed me down
You fuckin' up my focus, bro, I'm really on some more shit
Ain't been on the scene that much, I'm somewhere gettin' loaded
Ain't talkin' 'bout weed that I smoked or lean that I po'd
I'm talkin' 'bout this money I'm savin' up, I been in the tuck
Fuckin' with me, winin' the lottery, ayy, who feelin' lucky?
Know some real ones ready to slide with me if I press the button
People who done really been down from me, they don't ask for nothin'
Keepin' it one million, I'm too real to say that I'm one hundred
You are not the one 'cause you got money, real shit
[Chorus]
I don't know what they told you, but you got me fucked up
You see how we walked in? You can't see we run stuff?
I gotta think out the box, I hate bein' bunched up
Glad that I been through a lot, it made me a monster
I done seen this shit get grimy, I can't have no conscience
See 'em tryna clone me and all, but it's only one me
If I came in this world alone, why I get lonely?
Can someone come unthaw my heart? I think it's frozen

[Verse 2]
I don't feel a lot of this shit, I can't even hold you
Catch me in the Hamptons with Mike Rubin or HOV them
Or catch me in the hood with a Lamborghini with the doors up
I can't even lie, it broke my heart, I heard you told some
Gotta keep my fire under my jacket, it's a cold world
She with me when he go out to practice, this a cold girl
She a goblin, she don't even stop it, make your toes curl
Bae, I'm sorry for puttin' our business out there
You too cool for losing, you could be winnin' out here
You keep it wet, I'm gon' invest, support yo' swimmin' line
Don't worry 'bout that, just do yo' best, I promise you'll be fine
You let that shit come out yo' mouth, now you can't press rewind, it's stuck there
Five million cash, all blues, you get a rush, yeah
I don't need a nigga or a bitch, who the fuck cares?
You the one that's really sour, I ain't even gon' go there
You was 'posed to be here, but oh well

I don't know what they told you, but you got me fucked up

All of my whips got that new car smell
Don't get it twisted, from the 'partments, I just park well
I don't fuck with him, that nigga flawed, send him to voicemail
Catch up with him, push up on him, tell him how we all feel
Made myself a millionaire, only took a year, dawg
Thinkin' bout what I been through, I can make a tear fall
Late night with them youngins, we was creepin', could've killed y'all
We ain't gon' do that internet beefin', that's for bitches, dawg
I went up to space so they hatin', they can't lift off
I can make your bitch eat my kids, every drip drop
I come from trenches, we can't come outside in flip flops
I done came so far, sittin' on the floor, watchin' the tip-off

[Chorus]
Bought her baby Gucci strollers (Strollers)
Switch it up and I went global (Global)

Catch the SunCatch the Sun Lyrics[Intro]
(Hit-Boy)

[Verse 1]
Seems like we runnin' outta time
Yeah, we still so young and got so much to find
We can't never let 'em break our mind
We gotta stay strong, conquer and don't divide
I come in peace, my heart already set on fire
If it ain't color, what's the difference from you and I?
I'll let you decide or come up with some repeated lies
I'm just tired of my kind gotta be the one to die
Lookin' in the sky, I know you with me, I can't cry
Standin' what I stand on, I can't never switch sides
Sometimes I just wanna pop out on 'em and flip by
But I put my head on, I pray, I stay from off the route
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas, I ain't seen 'em in a while
Thinkin' 'bout my son, I just had another child
I been thinkin' back on bro, like, "What the fuck we gon' do now?"
On this road to redemption, this shit get rocky and it's wild
Let me tell you 'bout it
[Chorus]
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest
I'm so dumb that I was thinkin' that they could
When they really can't, yeah
I was thinkin' that they was, when they really ain't
It's my fault, I can't blame no one
If we take off now, we can catch the sun
Maybe watch it set, have sex, get some rest

[Verse 2]
Know you be behind me if it ever came to this
But I never would've thought that we'll have to take this risk
Or ever be in this position, just keep ridin', don't go missing
If we in this together, this the way it 'posed to feel
I'm going out with a bang, I'm tellin' you what it is
If I get racial profiled where I live
'Cause my crib bigger than theirs, or my cars up to date
Or it's probably be my girl shape, they probably wanna date her
Or they heard I got my cake up, middle finger to them haters
My life finally matters, I got up and I'ma stay up
I know it lookin' like a dream, but it ain't everything it seem
Ain't no tellin' where I be if I ain't have God or ain't have my team
Can't let 'em trick me out the streets, I got a mind of my own
I left the house at sixteen, I told my Mama, "I'm grown"
Been through a lot of situations, I can handle my own
If I had only one call, I know you pick up the phone
If they ain't with us, we gone

(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)
(Section 8 just straight cooked that motherfucker up)
Yeah
So we was at a gas station today, I told the bros, like
Last one home owe a dub, know what I'm sayin'?
And we all ridin' in foreigns, so
That shit super fun cuttin' all through traffic, sayin'
Kinda felt like I made it for a change
That's what I do
[Verse 1]
Lamborghini truck, big Dre in the cut
Bruh them Bentley-ed up behind me, know what's in my cup
Doin' ninety in a thirty-five like I don't give a fuck (I'm sorry)
Aventador, I let lil' Q 'dem drive, make sure y'all don't hit nobody
I can't lie, this rap shit got us livin' like we hit the lottery
Crippin', knockin' niggas out, one punch like he got into boxing
I been flying state to state for drip, I done got into shopping
Every other day, it's somethin' fake, I'm duckin' paparazzi
He ain't listen, they tapped his nugget
Label told me ain't got no budget
This ain't that, and that ain't 'bout nothing
I got rich, but got folks still strugglin'
I got bros give a fuck 'bout nothin'
I got hoes, don't give a fuck 'bout fuckin'
I ain't did that if she ain't got no butt
Money bring problems, okay, so what?
Pee them too real, they bought me a Rolls truck
Sent it back to get a newer version
Cullinan with the stars in it, got the captain seats in the back
I want the white paint with the red guts, all my other cars need to match it
They be like, "Ooh, ooh," off in traffic
Gotta put racin' gas in my track kit

[Chorus]
Get money (Get money), get money (Get money)

They offerin' the shooter the death penalty, won't tell on me
I know if I go broke today, them same hoes gon' bail on me
I got them throwin' salt, they steady tryna fuck up my recipe
Amiri jeans, a hundred a pair, ain't nothin' about a nigga cheap
Sellin' weed in the projects, relapsed on the Hi-Tech
Told the gang that we up next, put 'em on a G5 jet
Overseas with my sidepiece, my queen, she gotta be a dimepiece
We gon' stick together like assigned seats, on that Dej Loaf, nigga, try me
Whoever thought I'd put a hundred on my neck?
Whoever thought that I'd say I'm the one up next?
Whoever thought they'd ever consider me the best?
Whoever thought, whoever thought, whoever thought?

[Verse 2]
Go and ask about me in the streets, they heard of me
If she find out I been creepin', she gon' murder me
I ain't trippin', no complaints, I got my currency up
Out of town, I let the windows down so they can see us
I take the hitters around the globe, that's all I know (That's all I know)
I met her last night she tried to give me her soul (Give me her soul)
I got 'em hatin', they throwin' shots, they on their toes
One thing they know (One thing they know)
One thing they know (One thing they know)
Ain't gon let up on them niggas, once you try us, ain't gon' stop
If it's pressure, let me know, so we can pull up with them Glocks
Tryna dodge the bullshit and tryna make it to the top
If I never sell a record I'ma make it on the block
How you gon wait 'til I make it then try to help me? Nigga I don't need you (No help)
I put the food on the table, nigga was hungry, I tried to feed you

My baby, my whip cost two-fifty, I'm splurgin'
Got five million cash just in case of emergency
My young niggas kill, get away, they be purgin'
It happened like this, I ain't do it on purpose
I'm working my move, nigga, which one of you workin'?
I turned on my crew, bought a coupe off of verses
I'm tired of these strippers, I'm going at nurses and doctors and dentists
You started, I finished, I told you we with it
My word is like gold to my city
I tell 'em to go, they gon' get it
I heard that you froze when they hit it
Putting these hoes in the business, you know that you tripping

Knowin' these niggas be sweet and some bitches, I'm different

Cullinan shot in, my driver named Solid
I keep him on point, make sure nobody follow us
I got a Glock with a shot that can stop a truck
I get the money eight ways like an octopus
No way in hell I'ma give all these choppers up
Team full of players, ain't nobody stopping us
He out of line, give a fuck, then we poppin' him
Been raisin' hell, back in school, I was popular, yeah
All of my hoes get facials, face me
Make her my bitch too much, she lazy
I was thinking prices too high, then I raised 'em
Shit in my bank account gettin' outrageous
Niggas smellin' like that, had to switch up my fragrance
And I'm sending out shots if the fouls get flagrant
Switch up my route to the house, had to change it

Hit the bitch for a rack, then ignore her
I'm so sick of these rats and these whores

Best of MeBest of Me Lyrics[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Still poppin' Percocet
Drankin' lean too
Shit I gotta deal with

[Chorus]
Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me
I been through it all, I came this far how a nigga not gon' feel me
Ain't no facade, no cap in my raps everything that I say is the real me
I give all my problems to God
Let him handle all my enemies
I get on my knees and beg him please I just hoping that he hearin' me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get ahead of me
I came too far to stop now, I can't let a nigga get the best of me
[Verse 1]
Remember that shoot out we had that time we thought a kid died
Only thing I know when we pulled up, everybody hopped out firin'
I remember on the way back, everybody in the car quiet
I'm just knowing everybody thinkin' we just pulled a homicide, homicide
See me on the news at the spot
Tryna see who they say got shot
I'm the first one stood up, told my brothers y'all all I got
Know if somebody seen us they gon' talk
Phone ringin' I thought it was a thottie
Thinkin' damn, "we just caught a body"
Hopin' everybody keep it solid
Fuck the nigga, I'm thinkin' bout the kid
The nigga shouldn't did what he did
I'm just glad a nigga still here for all the stupid shit that we did
Gotta be here for my kid, gotta watch my son get big
Everything I say is no lie, I'm just glad the kid didn't die

[Chorus]
Caught a few cases, I been on the road but overall a nigga still free
I done been robbed I know how it feel, a nigga gon' have to come kill me

All I see is young niggas on Instagram with them sticks
I never post no gun, but when it's smoke I bet I send a blitz
That bullshit that you on thinkin' cool get you a 100 years
I bet yo partner fuck yo bitch, I bet you don't hear nothin' from the clique
I ain't gon' tell you no lie, this shit'll make a grown man cry
Folks give yo ass that time, you'll never see the outside
All you do is think and wonder why
Kiss the good life goodbye
Now you gotta fight to survive, ain't no guns all you got is knives
Hear a nigga sharpen 'em at night
Young niggas gone on the ice
Grown men fucking grown men they'll never tell you that part
Buy a phone you gotta have a spot
Everyday a nigga get knocked
Search team turn to the narcs, man this shit can really get hard

ErrbodyErrbody Lyrics[Intro]
Firin' at everybody
Firin' at everybody
(Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Firin' at everybody

[Chorus]
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it
Boy, you play, you gon' die front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him
[Verse 1]
I used to pray for a plug who gon' go out the way
And come back with a lot of them bitches
I used to dream about condos when we leavin' Lenox
Now I stay on top of them bitches
I wouldn't give a damn if he ran him up a whole billion
I still wouldn't acknowledge the nigga
He put my name in a song, what the fuck is he on?
I don't care, boy, we gotta go get him
House big as fuck in the middle of nowhere
I dick her down, I don't care what my ho wear
I made Lil' Cam spin the block on a four-wheel
Nah, for real, spin the block on a four-wheel
Five million dollars, for me, that ain't no deal
I done made that times six in like three years
Off this rap shit, I can't even talk about this trap shit
I just hope they can take it, I keep me a stallion like Megan
A residency out in Vegas
Might fly to L.A. and go fuck with LeBron and the Lakers
Come back to Atlanta with Jayda
Bruh told us to take care of the neighbors and stack all the paper
Whatever we want, buy it later
I know how to shit on a hater and handle the business
Whatever God give me, I'm grateful

[Chorus]
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it
Boy, you play, you gon' die front of everybody
Leave some blood on the street, buy some red bottoms
Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em

Cartier watches for everyone 'round me
I ran it up, how the fuck could you down me?
She set for life, how the fuck could you clown her?
Bought all this water, I'm never gon' drown
I'm in the 'yo, I'm perfectin' my sound
I helped 'em out and they let me down again
I ain't comin' back around again
Fell in love and I found a friend
I done geared up the motor
My brother in prison in Polo
I jumped in the game and went loco
I put on these clothes like a hobo
That's layers of drip
I showed my ass in Phipps
You play, ya mans get killed
Said that before, but I'm dead for real
Lil' bro jumpin' 'round like his leg done healed
I ran it up off of vacuum seal
If I fall off today, I'm a legend still
Bro showed me the way, I ain't never steal
This Glock ain't no prop, it'll pop for real
I fuck with that syrup, I don't pop no pills
My young niggas turnt, they don't got no deals
I need me a billion so I can chill
I'm drivin' like I ain't got no license still
My Trackhawk move like it got nitrogen, I'm poppin' seals
[Chorus]
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it

Caught an L, but I wish that they headshot 'em
Free my nigga Longway, yeah, the feds got him

[Verse 3]
I paid attention and found out the recipe
I take a seat and they still won't get 'head of me
I'm on my shit, now a bitch can't get next to me
You ain't got a hundred thou', you can't have sex with me
Ain't showed the best of me yet
And ain't in nobody debt, I'm somethin' like a vet
I bought my big brother a 'Vette
My numbers so good, my label probably owe me a check
They play with Lil Baby, I swear it's gon' go down
The biggest lil' nigga that's over at Motown
Jumped off the porch and went straight kicked the door down
Flip the clip, switch the clip, then some more rounds
Rappers fake and be hatin', I don't go 'round
I took 12 on a chase, I had four ounces
Ask around, we them guys, I do no clownin'
If I can, I'ma try keep the smoke down
Once it's up, then it's stuck, it can't go down
Like to switch where I sleep, I got four houses
Every time the heat come, I make four thousand
Big done gave me the game and I ran with it
Milk the game 'til I quit, I ain't playin' with it
Could've been hit your bitch, I be sparin' niggas
Make me mad, I'ma call up them grave diggers
Bought my mom a new crib, and it's way bigger
Never been to it once, that's a great feelin'
I'ma go there when I get a chance
I lost five hundred racks before I signed a deal
Swear to God, I still got my advance
Yeah, I'm lit, I been savin' this guala up
Yeah, I hit, but she didn't get a follow-up
Ain't no reason to beef with no one about none of these women
I promise they swallow us all

[Chorus]
I'm firin' at everybody
Helicopter the middle of the hood, I'm flyer than everybody
All this fame these niggas be chasin', I swear I don't care 'bout it
Boy, you play, you gon' die front of everybody

Crush a LotCrush a Lot Lyrics[Intro]
Cook that shit up, Quay

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with shawty, know she’ll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' ’em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her
I crush a lot, baby girl, I'm a player
Connect the dots then I plug up the scale
If we get caught, they gon' give me the chair
Fuck the law, make 'em earn what they pay 'em
[Verse 1]
Ain't no back and forth with no bitches, this ain’t tennis
Rolls Royce truck, bitch, it ain’t rented
And they braggin' ’bout bitches, I promise we hit 'em
I flooded my wrist, let the bros split a million
At this point I'm heartless I ain't got no feelings
Buy every building in the hood for my children
Like a Drake song, got your vibe feelin’ groovy
With no phone, we can make us a movie
I ain't in my bag, I still got my feet out
If we wanted smoke with y'all, you couldn't be out
Free the bros, buy my shit off the kiosk
I'm at the vibe with the spot, this the creep house
Lil' shawty suck it like she just took her teeth out
Five percent tint on the whip, you can't see out
Ready to set it off, Queen Latifah
These niggas talk like bitches, see what they be 'bout

[Chorus]
I can't fuck with shawty, know she'll tell
Slim shit, look like Draya Michele
I been goin' crazy, givin' 'em hell
She ain't tryna go with me, I'ma pay her

They got consequences in this life of sin
Laugh about it, go in Gucci, spend a ten
When you come home, we gon' all win
Go in any club and make it thunderstorm, this shit reckless
He gon' knock you off with his Rollie on
Drive the Rolls Royce like a hotbox, really came from nothin'
Only ride with my security because I can't be armed
Can't get caught with another gun
They gon' know me when I'm gone
They hear my pain inside my songs
It's like a switch, I cut it on
Pills kick in, gettin' in my zone
Do my job, ain't see no wrong
I'm never talkin' on them phones
Feds gon' try to do us wrong
Man, they got my nigga Long
Lately I just been alone
My cup, my strap, this microphone
Nobody know what's goin on
Just glad I made it off the road
Granddaddy showed me life is a gamble
Ever since I been on them dice
They gon' suck it up like a bowl of rice
I'ma give it to them niggas every time

I can't fuck with shawty, know she'll tell

Cook that shit up, Quay

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I come from a different type of cloth than these niggas
I'ma buy a different type of car than these niggas
Ain't gon' fuck on none of these lil' bitches, they be hittin'
I gotta switch it up, man, I gotta move different, I'm a boss nigga
Yeah, show them youngins how to level up
Four Season hotel, sixty levels up
But I'm a resident
If you gon' do the crime, go hard, don't leave no evidence
I got 'em all on my wave 'cause it's evident
But where was y'all when I was lost, ain't know where to go?
She think I'm fly, she like my pimpin', but I can't save no ho
You only get one chance to cross me, then it's say no more
I gotta tell 'em go
I ain't hit your baby mama, I hit her with the curveball
I ain't hit your baby mama, I hit her with the curveball
And I'm still the same young hitter, used to serve y'all
Don't ever get it twisted, my youngins really flip shit
My youngins really flip shit, don't ever get it twisted
'Cause I'll really flip shit
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I don't need no friends, I just wanna win
I got this new Benz and it's all I need
She listen to her friends, they wanna get in
She don't understand that they'll slob on me
If I let 'em, ain't gon' let up, I'ma keep on stridin'
Heard they lookin' for me, I can't tell 'cause I ain't hidin'
It don't matter if I'm frownin' 'cause my mama smilin'
I done finally went legit, ain't no more public housing
I gotta stay from 'round them

[Verse 2: Rylo Rodriguez]
I'm gon' pull up AMG like I don't know my alphabet
Youngins ain't on Instagram but they still want a blue check
If 12 go'n grab one more of my dawgs, I'ma sue the vet
I thought they all wanna see me ball, they'd rather go hide the nets
All these pointers in my watch but my Rolex ain't tellin' (Hell nah)
Know the drank the devil but when I'm on it, feel like I'm in heaven
In the hood shootin' dice, ask what it playin', we told him, "7"
Used to go to church 'til I seen MC serve the reverend
Pockets gettin' biggie, no Smalls, Faith Evans
Wonder why she don't wanna fuck when I ain't wearin' my necklace
They ain't picture me like this so I sent all them selfies
Pray you don't get caught in the mix, 'cause when we slide, it's deadly
I'ma pay her for that pussy, I won't lie, they petty
Nine hundred on jeans, we came from wearin' Moschino
When the paper comin' in, it'll drive you senile
It'll drive you crazy (It'll drive you insane)
Pray you take these lines and look back, oh, they all faded

I got too many cars, I ain't payin' no note (Note)
Too many chains, go to sleep, I might choke (Choke)
I be sippin' on syrup, I ain't drivin' no boat (Boat)
We in the store, she don't know which one gold
This bitch think that she slick, but I'm buyin' 'em both
We on Rodeo, lil' bro got his heater
I walk in Moncler and buy everyone coats
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I'm a hyena, since everyone G.O.A.T.'s
Team full of shooters, pull up and they score
I got the drop on the opp, it's a go
I get two hundred racks every night for a show
I know it's a blessing
Christian Dior and Jordan 11's ('Leven)
I just hope I can dunk into Heaven (Heaven)
I just fucked on an actress for breakfast, I hope she ain't messy
I just be fuckin' bitches, I don't be textin' 'em
It ain't no in the middle, shoot the messenger
He won't let nobody get the best of him
Oh, you don't know Scotty? Take a Tesla
Plus she won't let me get it in, so I left her there
I got too many women, Baby Hefner
I let the lil' bros keep the extra
I used the baking soda, we was stretchin' 'em
Making these deals, numbers come in decimals
Or I might get bored and buy a bitch a hair salon
I'ma pay for it, bruh, ain't never have to front
I make a million dollars every other month
As soon as I get done, I'ma give her some
Not like the rest of 'em, I'm a different one
I had to shoot back, I ain't get to run
Can't let a fuck nigga take my mama's son

Dreams 2 RealityDreams 2 Reality Lyrics[Intro: Lil Baby]
Al Geno on the track
G just bounced back from a headshot
Trappin' by the roadblock
I only give until my legs out
Been a real nigga 'til my legs stop
Real trapper, my legs tired
Real trapper, my legs tired
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: NoCap]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Yeah)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (Yeah)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily
Got a little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
If I had never made a hit, would they be on my dick?
I just been sittin' back and pushin' pounds, just gettin' fit
And I got a 60 on my right wrist, I'm movin' fast like lightnin'
These other rappers tryna bite me, your baby mama wanna bite me
I swear to God she triflin', I pass her on 'cause I'm righteous
I run the jungle like Tarzan, that codeine was like poison
I cut back, I feel awesome, no playoffs but I'm ballin'
Had a good day, I scored 40 and I ain't talkin' points
I close my eyes, I still have flashbacks when I was in the joint
I hit my knees, I'm thankin' God, I'm prayin' every mornin'
I check the schedule and I'm booked up, I'm finally tourin'
I'm goin' where I wanna go, doin' what I wanna do
I can screw who I wanna screw, I came from nothin', I can never lose
Turned my dreams into reality, I thought that you'd be glad for me
I can't believe that you mad at me, damn, dawg, I'm proud of you
My life was garbage, too, but I did what I 'posed to do
And I went and bought the latest coupe, told my young nigga stay in school
But he ain't listen, now he got a .45 in the kitchen with a biscuit ready to flip it

[Chorus: Lil Baby & NoCap, NoCap, & Lil Baby]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Had to be)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Reality)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (I feel 'em after me)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily (I don't do it happily)
Got little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate

Don't wanna fuck around and kill my dawg, they gon' do me like I'm Vick
Yeah, they gon' really hate me if I sign a deal
I'ma go buy a Wraith, crash it on purpose, blame it on the pills
When Lil' Joe be slidin', it be look like he headed to second base
I see the hate, it look like makeup, it's all on their face
I can't see Fred no more so I be talkin' to his headstone
Sometimes I wanna catch a body, but I put my head on
Crawford finna touch down, he in the red zone
I sure got tired of sendin' him naked pictures of my red bone
Yeah, G just bounced right back off a headshot
Yeah, I won't fuck that bitch if she ain't got no ass shots
Put them choppers on the jet, we gon' air it out
25 hundred on some trap gear, we gon weigh it out
Too much dirty money, won't put that shit in the shower
Even when lights out, boy, that money still bring power
Can't serve a lot of white, but that shit look like baby powder
Got my gun at every show, I don't care if it ain't crowded
I barely sleep, but when I do, I just be dreamin'
They know I came from the bottom like bikinis
When I can't get hold to them Percs, I be fiendin'
Why would you tell me that you love me and you don't mean it?
[Chorus: NoCap]
My life was hard, it just had to be (Yeah)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (Yeah)

Word on the StreetWord on the Street Lyrics[Intro]
We Global now

[Verse 1]
Word on the street, they got a lil' bitty hit out
Really run Atlanta, I can make a nigga get out
If anything, I have more respect for you bitches
Nigga, you a bitch, we don't shoot and miss (Nah)
Glock-19 unfold and it spit out
Double R underneath the door when I get out
Clutchin' on my fans, had to tell lil' bro to chill out
How the fuck your whole gang down the road and you still out?
Undercover rat, pussy nigga, you a sellout
Every show I get either packed or it sell out
I been ballin' hard, you on the bench, you gotta sit out
Know a nigga mad, he can't even put a hit out
Middle of the winter, drop top with a mink on
Bad lil' vibe, yeah, she say that's her theme song
I done made a whole million dollars off a flip phone
No Soulja Boy, that bitch ain't even have a ringtone
[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen

[Verse 2]
Call overseas, tell them youngins to spin again
I don't throw rocks and hide my hand 'cause I'm a man
Million cash in the book bag, I'm a big dog
Threw my shot at any nigga, bitch, I think I'm Chris Paul
Sippin' all these meds, nigga gotta be throwed off
I was gettin' head, fucked around and I dozed off
Rolls Royce truck, crank it and let the nose out
Everything I said, I went did it, boy, I'm the chosen child

[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen

Safe deposit boxes on fleek
And my bank account, I don't touch it, I'ma get it out the street
Got your vibe all on my drip, she say you cheap
And she know I'm havin' money, buy her titties, ass, and teeth
Catchin' three flights every day, the only time I get some sleep
Kept it real and they be cappin', really you can't compete
I spend it all on bullets, niggas don't wanna beef
Got a D-boy swag, pull up SRT
I ain't playin' with nobody, nobody gon' play with me
Got a driver for my car, he take me from A to Z
Got some homies on the yard I probably'll never see
If the money was the issue I promise they'd be free
They was sleepin' on me bad, they fucked around, woke up a beast
Switch it up, I went romantic, took my shawty out to Greece
Every city that I go to, gotta link up with the street
I'm too humble for 'em, guess that's why they thinkin' I was sweet

[Chorus]
Skinny Mike Amiris like I skate
We just fuck around, we don't date
I went straight up there to Mars, so they hate
And I got a lot of cars, they all up to date
I was at the bottom, literally I was boxed in
Then I took off, I ain't have no other option
I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen4Embed

Get UglyTranslationsPortuguêsGet Ugly Lyrics[Intro: Young Scooter]
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob

[Chorus]
It can get ugly (Huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?
From the bottom, all I know is the struggle
Can't get no job, so all I know is the hustle

[Verse 1]
Yeah, bankroll gettin' bigger (Nigga)
Empire gettin' built up, givin' racks to the right nigga
I can get a pack overnight, ain't nothin' like you niggas
Sippin' syrup 'til my body numb, I ain't tryna catch no feelings
I ain't never bite no nigga
She give me brain now 'cause I'm famous
I got these chains on, gettin' tangled
I'm in the big Benz, not a Wrangler
It's still a Jeep though, it ain't cheap, ho
I'm just happy they gon' free Rico
Dodgin' stank hoes and R.I.C.O.
On a Sprinter van with them Dracos
Probably ridin' around with Starlito
I'ma bust it down with my lil' bros
Buy cars for all of my kinfolk
If the sack ever did get low
God knows it's gon' be a robbery
Why the fuck everybody callin' me?
Everybody who left took a part of me
Excuse my drip, yeah, pardon me
Show me a list of who hard as me
[Chorus]
It can get ugly (Huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?
From the bottom, all I know is the struggle
Can't get no job, so all I know is the hustle

[Verse 2]
Right back after tour, ain't got time for no attitude
Why I cannot lose, feel like I had to do it
I'm in my savage mood, put a lil' back into it
Treat me with gratitude, I ain't no average dude
Need my rims offset like Cardi B
This might be my hardest beat
Put the blame on Pee, he started me
Got the game from Big, he guarded me
Coach threw me in, took me out the streets
Now I get racks to rap on beats
I still know plugs with packs for cheap
Killers owe favors, they'll whack for free
Never did fraud, I got cash receipts
Lotta niggas get they swag from me
Don't tell nobody 'bout bags from me
You were not in the street, you wouldn't last a week
My bitch so bad, I pass on freaks
I'm here 'cause my granny be prayin' for me
None of these niggas ain't playin' with me
Got hitters that'll sit in that can for me, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
It can get ugly (Huh)
Would you leave or stay like you love me?
From the bottom, all I know is the struggle
Can't get no job, so all I know is the hustle, yeah8Embed
