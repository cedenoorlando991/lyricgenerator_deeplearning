28 ContributorsLovely Lyrics[Verse 1]
I almost fell in love with you
After the club last night
They don't know what you do (Oh)
Money's gon' treat you right

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, don't act like you changed
When we both know you can't
And I know you love me
'Cause I think you're lovely

[Chorus]
Girl, check my coat (Baby won't you check my coat)
Drop that ass on the floor (Drop that ass on the floor)
See you move on that pole (Way you move on that pole)
Baby, look at you go (Baby, look at you go)
Girl, check my coat (Baby, won't you check my coat)
Drop that ass on the floor (Drop that ass on the floor)
See you move on that pole (Way you move on that pole)
Baby, look at you go (Baby, look at you go)

[Verse 2]
I almost fell in love with you
After the club last night
And you told me don't spend too much
Girl, take your own advice
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, don't act like you changed
When we both know you can't
And I know you love me
'Cause I think you're lovely

[Chorus]
Girl, check my coat (Baby, won't you check my coat)
Drop that ass on the floor (Drop that ass on the floor)
See you move on that pole (Way you move on that pole)
Baby, look at you go (Baby, look at you go)
Girl, check my coat (Baby, won't you check my coat)
Drop that ass on the floor (Drop that ass on the floor)
See you move on that pole (Way you move on that pole)
Baby, look at you go (Baby, look at you go)4Embed
