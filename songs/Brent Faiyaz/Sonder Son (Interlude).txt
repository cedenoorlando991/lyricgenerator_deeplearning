20 ContributorsSonder Son (Interlude) Lyrics[Verse 1]
To you
It might look like I'm just doing what I want right now
Like who I'm with, just what I want right now
That shit just might be true enough right now
Maybe I just can't open up
I don't trust anyone
I don't know what they want
That's why chances are, I got shades on when we talk
No us, I'm alone

[Verse 2]
But I done told you I'm just doing what I want right now
Who I'm with, just who I want right now
That shit just might be true enough right now
Maybe I just can't open up, I don't trust anyone
Oh, you know I'm up
Don't tell me enough is enough
Just 'cause you ain't the one
Yeah, ooh

[Outro]
You ain't gotta (Oh, lord)
You ain't gotta wait on me, wait on me (You ain't gotta)
You ain't gotta (You ain't gotta wait)
You ain't gotta wait on me, wait on meYou might also like2Embed
