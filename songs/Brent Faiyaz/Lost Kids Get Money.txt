19 ContributorsLost Kids Get Money Lyrics[Intro]
Esahc t'nod yenom—
Rof em ta—
Llorknab taht— esahc t'nod yenom
Rof em ta— Mm, yeah

[Verse 1]
I just pull up in this bitch
In the function with my clique
I stay in the back, big thing on my hip
Fuckin' in the back, I stay with a bitch
Smellin' like a lick, smellin' like Margiela
Seein' is believin', I don't see none of you fellas (Stevie Wonder)
Dropped a song and these famous bitches love it
I'm a dog, they don't root for me in public
If I hit it then it ain't worth no discussion
We the reason that our city buzzin'
All my bros collect, all my bros is next
Who need work? I could plug you with connects
Shit get hot, who you call collect?
Who you just finesse? Go lay low out West

[Chorus]
Money get lost when you don't chase it (Go out and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost when you don't chase it (Go out and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost when you don't chase it (Go out and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost when you don't chase it (Go out and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankroll

What you mean, you ain't gettin' no bread? (Bread)
All my fuckin' soldiers get paid
If you on the block today (Hey)
Don't let one-two take your guap away
Just took a ride in the Rover through my old hood with my friends
I'm still pipin' hoes from like 2010
They heard about my moves, they know I'm the man
I got too much to lose, fuckin' on these fans
I paid all my dues, plus I never ran
I need all the loot, put it in my hand, uh
Better grab your girl 'cause I'ma fuck her (I will)
She chose up, I do it like no other, no
Anywhere I wanna go, I been doin' all these shows
I be spendin' all this dough

[Chorus]
Money get lost when you don't chase it (Go out and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost when you don't chase it (Go out and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost when you don't chase it (Go out and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankroll
Money get lost when you don't chase it (Go out and chase it)
What you lookin' at me for? Should be lookin' at bankroll
[Outro]
Money get lost when you don't chase it8Embed
