11 ContributorsNatural Release Lyrics[Verse]
She come from a hostile place
Bruises on her pretty face
Travel to a foreign land
Married to a foreign man
The ocean's blue and the weather's nice
But life is far from paradise
She picks up a magazine
And she's turned on by what she sees
Close the door and shut the blinds
She's about to ease her mind
Thoughts of peace and happiness
Travel to her finger tips
He comes home to rest his head
He walks upstairs to go to bed
He hears her moaning through the door
He goes downstairs into the drawer
He sees a box and takes it out
Then, aims the gun into his mouth
She hears a bang and she runs downstairs
To see her husband lying there
Close the door and shut the blinds
She fights off tears and dries her eyes
Thoughts of peace and happiness
They're all gone (gone)
