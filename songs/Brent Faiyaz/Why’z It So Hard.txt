Pardon me, L-O-R-D
Why's it so hard out here for niggas like me?
Pardon me, L-O-R-D
Why’s it so hard out here for niggas like me?

[Verse 1]
Don't test, them bullets might press
Why they wanna see me dead? I ain't even grown yet
Baby, you got too much to offer
That’s prolly why they want you in a coffin
Baby you're too young to sink it all in
Damn

Pardon me, L-O-R-D
Why's it so hard out here for niggas like me?
Pardon me, L-O-R-D
Why's it so hard out here for niggas like me?

[Verse 2]
I know I ain't been the easiest to deal with
As of late
Twenty-two, with a lot on my plate
But you never know when you gotta go
Sometimes I can't wait
