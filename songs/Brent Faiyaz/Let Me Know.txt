Who can I love when they tell me I can't love myself?
How in the hell could I possibly love someone else?
Who can I love when they tell me I can't love myself? (Let me know, for them niggas like me)
How in the hell could I possibly love someone else?
Who can I love when they tell me I can't love myself? (Let me know, it don't matter what they say 'bout you)
How in the hell could I possibly love someone else?
(Let me know)
Who can I love when they tell me I can't love myself? (Let me know, for them niggas like me)
How in the hell could I possibly love someone else?

[Verse 1]
Some things we can't explain
Why do we act this way?
Why don't we make it easier for the world to change someday?
Sometimes I contemplate, some things my heart can't take
Why do we hurt one another? Fight our brother, kill, and rape?
Love can trump it all
I know you seen it all
And know you a star, you just have to believe in who you are
Who can you love?

[Chorus]
Who can I love when they tell me I can't love myself? (Let me know, for them niggas like me)
How in the hell could I possibly love someone else?
Who can I love when they tell me I can't love myself? (Let me know)
How in the hell could I possibly love someone else?
(Let me know)
Who can I love when they tell me I can't love myself? (Let me know)
How in the hell could I possibly love someone else?

And with livin' comes with ills
Don't let 'em make you feel like the world can't heal
It's hard out here
Despite your fears, keep holdin' on
With all those tears, you can't hold 'em on
And how?
Could somebody else know you, if you don't know you, you're searchin'
But what's missin' is your heart
Who can I love?

[Chorus]
Who can I love when they tell me I can't love myself? (Let me know, for them niggas like me)
How in the hell could I possibly love someone else?
(Let me know)
Who can I love when they tell me I can't love myself? (Let me know)
How in the hell could I possibly love someone else? (Yeah, hey)
Who can I love when they tell me I can't love myself? (Let me know, for them niggas like me)
How in the hell could I possibly love someone else?5Embed
