Your eyes, like the sunshine on my face
It's a good night, how your smell's nice on my pillowcase
And I light all up when I see you walkin' by
I know that life ain't perfect but you make it alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I see you comin'
Got my heart jumpin' like Jordans
Play me like Spalding, do it all for me
Girl, you're the vision of what I like
And I promise I'll be yours
Tell me your joys and your problems
I'll be more than the man for ya
I'll be your friend

[Chorus]
Call me, I'll be right away (I'll be there, girl, stay right there)
Tell me if you gonna stay down (Will you stay down?)
I'll be waitin' night and day (I'll be waitin' night and day)
But only if you gonna stay down (stay down, stay down)

[Verse 2]
Your lips, feel like sweet silk on my skin
And fate's real, it's a great feelin' how you sucked me in (ooh, you suck me in)
And I tossed all my fears to the wind when I touched your hand
And I know God must have really loved me to give me a chance

Girl you're the vision of what I like
I promise I'll be yours
Tell me your joys and your problems
I'll be more than the man for ya
I'll be your friend
Call me & I'll be right there

[Chorus]
Call me, I'll be right away (I'll be there, girl, stay right there)
Tell me if you gonna stay down (Will you stay down?)
I'll be waitin' night and day (I'll be waitin' night and day)
But only if you gonna stay down (stay down, stay down)

[Outro]
Call me, I'll be right away
Tell me if you gonna stay down
I'll be waitin' night and day
But only if you gonna stay down10Embed
