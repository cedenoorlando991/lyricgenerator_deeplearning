20 ContributorsSo Far Gone/Fast Life Bluez LyricsPart I: So Far Gone
[Verse 1]
You say you trust us
But don't pick the phone up
Act like we mean something to you
I know you doing you
I called your brother on the land-line
He said you ain't never got no down time
You always working so late
Hope that you safe
Your family been missing you, you come 'gon back this way?
You know it's real out here for us
It's like you don't care enough

[Chorus]
But out here baby boy's so far gone
Lord knows I ain't been home in so long
Game so deep and the drinks so strong
And I don't trust no one at all
Far away from you
I've already paid my dues
I don't got a lot but I'm making do
I'm trying just to get along

[Verse 2]
Went to muddy water from holy water
From being children, to slaying daughters
You might also like[Refrain]
Who gon' go to hell for me?
Tryna give myself a reason to keep believing in season that leaves fall for me
Say, boy don't talk to me
Get from 'round my way
Can't judge 'round my way

[Verse 3]
You gon' be so rich and don't ever show it
You can buy all the clothes you need and still don't visit me
I called your brother on his cell phone
He said you went out and you ain't been home
You're always partying late
Hope that you safe
You don't even message me when you leave out the States
You know it's real out here for us
Its like you don't care enough

[Chorus]
But out here baby boy's so far gone
Lord knows I ain't been home in so long
Game so deep and the drinks so strong
And I don't trust no one at all
Far away from you
I've already paid my dues
I don't got a lot but I'm making do
I'm trying just to get along
[Verse 4]
Went from being cozy to living crazy
From "you don't know me" to wanting babies

[Refrain]
Who gon' go to hell for me?
Tryna give myself a reason to keep believing in season that leaves fall for me
Say, boy don't talk to me
Get from 'round my way
Can't judge 'round my way

[Interlude]

Part II: Fast Life Bluez

[Verse 1]
It won't be too long
Till I'm not here to say how much you mean to me
One day
I won't be too long
I want you to stay strong
Cause it won't be too long
Just tell my baby close her eyes and wait for me to get off my vacation, yeah
My life just wasn't no place for ya
How can I lie?
Ooh, and I can't cry
This one's for my child, my child
I'll see you in your dreams tonight
This one here for my child, my child
I'll see you in your dreams tonight...
[Outro]
