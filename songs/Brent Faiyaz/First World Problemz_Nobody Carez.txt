[Verse 1]
Everyday, I come late
Wash my clothes in the same sink
I don't give a damn 'bout what they think
As long as I pay rent
I don't even whine 'bout my paycheck
I know it is short, but I make ends
'Cause it could be a worse situation

[Pre-Chorus]
All that glitters ain't gold
And all that shines bright ain't a diamond
And all that wrinkles isn't old
And as far as you see ain't the horizon

[Chorus]
A death in designer (Ain't everything)
To live on an island (Ain't everything)
We keep on tryin' (To have everything)
We'll end up dyin' (Over anything)

[Verse 2]
Everyday, I leave late
I wait out front in the same place
And I don't give a damn 'bout what they say
Long as the day ends
I made some plans with some good friends
I don't even know where the day went
But it could be the worst conversation

You know there's a roach on the floor?
Right there
Ah man

[Pre-Chorus]
All that glitters ain't gold
And all that shines bright ain't a diamond
All that wrinkles isn't old
And as far as you see ain't the horizon

[Chorus]
A death in designer (Ain't everything)
To live on an island (Ain't everything)
We keep on tryin' (To have everything)
We'll end up dyin' (Over anything)

Part II: Nobody Carez

Everybody want a motherfuckin' Benz or Beamer
Designer sneakers, ain't no motherfuckin' dreamers
Shit is deeper than Neiman
Mark us on your Hollywood starlets
Underneath there's niggas starvin', impoverished
People don't give no fucks, nigga
Trump don't give a fuck
Your niggas don't give a fuck
Your favorite artists don't give a motherfuckin' fuck
Do you give a fuck, nigga?
[Interlude 2]
Keep playin', motherfucker

[Chorus]
If you told 'em you was down and out
Would they pull up or would they wait it out?
Would they ever call you just to talk about
Whatever they wanna talk about?
If you borrowed money 'cause it's life or death
Would they ask you for their money back?
Would they tell the world all of your business?
And this and that? Your business and this and that

[Verse 1]
Maybe, you're too friendly or maybe you're too real
You put your time and faith in people that can't seal the deal
Trials and tribulation often force one to reveal
That maybe you just don't know what to feel
Did you know you were you with the devil last night?
Couldn't see where you was goin' with a flashlight
I know it burns, I'm just concerned. When will you learn?
I know that you were with the devil last night
& Baby I ain't sayin' you don't act right
This world don't love but that don't mean that you can't hope it does

[Chorus]
If you told em you was down and out
Would they pull up or would they wait it out?
Would they ever call you just to talk about
Whatever they wanna talk about?
If you borrowed money 'cause it's life or death
Would they ask you for their money back?
Would they tell the world all of your business?
And this and that? Your business and this and that14Embed
