20 ContributorsCame Right Back Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pick up the phone, and I'ma slide
I never wanna be that guy
You still talk about me a lot
I ain't never home, I like to ride
Used to have to stand outside
Now you hate the fact that I'm hot

[Hook]
And you say you don't miss me, then you miss me
Miss me with all that
Tried to cut my baby loose and she came right back
You say that you miss me, then you miss me
Miss me with all of that
Tried to cut my baby loose and she came right back

[Verse 2]
I've been selling out shows
Fuckin' hella, I been on a roll
'Bout to cop a Rover for the snow
Niggas wanna come 'round, niggas better know
(Damn)
Stressed out
What's even worse is this is how I get my checks now
We all guilty, I know niggas who ain't getting out
Why do I feel cursed if I'm so blessed now? (Why?)
You might also like[Hook]
And you say you don't miss me, then you miss me
Miss me with all that
Tried to cut my baby loose and she came right back
You say that you miss me, then you miss me
Miss me with all of that
Tried to cut my baby loose and she came right back

[Outro]
I know you lying like shit

[Skit]
Like, who the fuck would wanna be these niggas
I sent that video and she said thank you
Like real live like, we wanted you, you feel me
Like, we tryna see
If I book that shit, it's a wrap
I think I did, though
Part of me feel bad for these niggas, honestly
But like, fuck it for real
Right now it feels like everything's fallin', right
It's fallin' right into place
Everything we got now, we gettin'
It's like coming to fruition
Bro, it's crazy, 'cause it's like, the way niggas is movin' now
It's like we makin' moves, and it's like, we already plottin'
And lookin' past this shit, that we already
You feel me, like, man, that's the way it gotta be
They gone be sick to see where niggas at in like two years
Five years, ten years
And this only the beginning, too
For real, like
These niggas still like three, four steps behind and shit
Yeah, like
They still on the same shit we was on like, five years ago and shit
Yeah, like
I would hate to be these niggas, bro, like
Like, you got no clue
Just imagine being like, a nigga that's not me, like
Makes me wanna throw up
That shit sound fucked up, but it's like
Nigga, I do not want to be you
For real6Embed
