22 ContributorsWish You Well LyricsLyrics from Snippet

(Ooh)
Darling, I don't wish you well
When you ain't with me, I want you crying
I know it's wrong, but
I just gotta be honest
Pick me up, don't know if it's what I need
But it's what I want
God, look out for me, eee (Ah-ooh)
Yeah (Ah-ooh)You might also like3Embed
