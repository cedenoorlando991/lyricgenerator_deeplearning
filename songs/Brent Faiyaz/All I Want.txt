15 ContributorsAll I Want Lyrics[Verse 1]
She said "I don't really care where you been
But wherever you go save a place for me
I'll be by your side 'cause you're made for me
And I can't be alone"
She said "I don't really care 'bout your friends
But when you leave the house save a space for me
I'ma be around 'cause we're made to be
And I can't be alone"
Love's a crazy thing, can't believe we're here again
Lovers or friends, that all depends on you, shorty
Love you so deep
Maybe did I forget to mention
That you got all my attention, baby
Come and kick it lady

[Chorus]
All I want
Is for you to tell me that it's mine
And let me treat you right
All I want
Is for you to know you look divine
Standin' here beside me

[Verse 2]
She said "I don't give a damn how ya been
I only care to know what you're goin' through
I'ma be alright 'cause I'm made for you
This ain't just for show."
She said "I ain't got no time for the fence
I'm always makin' time for the things you do
I'ma stick around 'cause it's just us two
And I'll let that be known."
I don't care to play, I'm just glad you're here today
I made a move, now you can choose what you
Gon' do, you play it so cool
And baby did I forget to mention
That you got all my attention, baby
Come and kick it lady
You might also like[Chorus]
All I want
Is for you to tell me that it's mine
And let me get you right
All I want
Is for you to know you look divine
Standin' here beside me3Embed
