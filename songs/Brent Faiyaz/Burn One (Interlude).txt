29 ContributorsBurn One (Interlude) Lyrics[Verse 1]
You were the luckiest girl alive
You had your innocence then
Conquered the world every time you smiled
Now you don’t smile so often
I don't see you so much no more
I rarely pray, but I just pray that you're well
I know you cry every night
Blow it all in the sky
And I'ma burn one for you

[Verse 2]
You were the luckiest girl alive
And I was to call you my friend
You was who I was who you was
And we loved
You ain’t got but so many fucks to give
One life to live
So be true to you
They don't know what they say
And they don't know your secrets
And they don't know about when he took your light away
Just light it all into flames
And I'ma burn one for youYou might also like6Embed
