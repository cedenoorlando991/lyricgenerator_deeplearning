Only been a few hours, but it felt like days
Only been days, but it feel like months
I been gone for a year, only wrote like once
Life moves fast when you do what you want
I guess I'm doing what I want
Hope you doing what you want (What else?)
But what you want?
(I don't know)

[Verse 1]
My new bitch look like Halle Berry
But she don't love me, she too scary
My old bitch fine like Jackie Brown
I don't wanna love her, she too down
Will you be my leading lady?
I want a contract, girl no maybe
In the meantime (I guess I'm doing what I want)
Get some me-time (Hope you doing what you want)

[Bridge]
Maybе I don't love myself, I don't know
Leavе me here, I'll fuck myself
She be in the mirror, I duck myself
I don't need much so fuck my wealth

Only been a few hours, but it felt like days
Only been days, but it feel like months
I been gone for a year, only wrote like once
Life moves fast when you do what you want
I guess I'm doing what I want (You don't gotta front when life's a water front)
Hope you doing what you want (What else?)
But what you want?
(I don't know)
(You could play it loud?)

[Verse 2]
Crib by the beach like Ordell
No Beaumont, my killers don't tell
Chateau Marmont grabbed the Louis off the shelf
Now my bitch addicted to Chanel
Will you be my leading lady?
I want a contract, girl no maybe
In the meantime (I guess I'm doing what I want)
Get some me-time (I don't know)
(Hope you doing what you want)
My new bitch look like Halle Berry
But she don't love me, she too scary
My old bitch fine like Jackie Brown1Embed
