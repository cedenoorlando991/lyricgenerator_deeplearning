You said we don't even make love no more
I'm not sure, but you know that's not right (Mmm)
Why you sweating, babe?
Don't
'Cause I can't give you my life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's your fault for loving me
You put your trust in me
And I didn't ask
And I didn't ask
I ain't sign off for nothin' like that
I'm just doing me, I was coming right back
Why you left me alone?
And she knew I was coming home

[Chorus]
She know I been out here workin' 9 to 5 lately
And, baby gets on my fucking nerves bout the same shit
We don't speak the same language
We don't speak the same language
We don't speak the same language

[Verse 2]
You want me to call your phone and tell you I'm done
That there ain't no us no more
No
Girl ain't nobody ever gon' do you like me
Learn how to stand on your own 2 feet alone
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's your fault for loving me
You put your trust in me
And I didn't ask
And I didn't ask
I ain't sign off on nothin' like that
You gon treat me cold, I'ma dish it right back
Why you left me alone?
And she knew I was coming home

[Chorus]
She know I been out here working 9 to 5 lately
And, baby gets on my fucking nerves bout the same shit
We don't speak the same language
We don't speak the same language
We don't speak the same language
We don't speak the same language2Embed
