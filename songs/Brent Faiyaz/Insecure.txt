18 ContributorsInsecure Lyrics[Verse 1]
She said
You can't know what I've done
You can't go where I'm from
Your lips can lie
But your eyes can't hide you're too young
You're too young

[Pre-Chorus]
How I adore our love would be so true
I just wish you knew
I'd be all yours if my mind didn't wander, I've got scars
From a life before you

[Chorus]
Please don't think I'm insecure
I just can't trust no one else
Please don't think I'm insecure
I just feel safe by myself

[Verse 2]
She said
You can't know where I've gone
Or how far I've run
There's a reason why I can't apply all of me
Baby I ain't the one
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
How I adore our love would be so true
I just wish you knew
I'd be all yours if my mind didn't wander, I've got scars
From a life before you

[Chorus]
Please don't think I'm insecure
I just can't trust no one else
Please don't think I'm insecure
I just feel safe by myself

[Outro Skit]
[Tali?] you better hit- you can see
Yo 100
You can see
Keep it real that
Fucked up
A lot of times
We got a couple chicks, we used to have, fucking, word about one of them
Oh wait, so, it- it- something happened with it? It's not-?
Nah basically, like, like I'll have a chick right and I'll just be fucking her, and just so invested in fucking her but I don't give her like no relationship 'cause I don't want to do that
So this one stopped fucking with you?
Yeah she stopped fucking with me and then, ahh no this is not right nah
Damn bro, I'm 'bout to hit her phone
[laughing]
I was waiting for you to fuck that up
I was waiting for you to fuck that up
You ain't shit
Yeah you still doing it man
I told you don't fuck that up! I was like Fabe, "Don't fuck this up 'cause I'm gonna hit her phone!"
Aye Glenn
Damn
Nah don't do it bro
You- You just throwing, you throwing fucking... throwing coal in the fire
See I'm not like that
You see I'm not like that
I appreciate you for all that you're worth because you're a beautiful strong woman12Embed
