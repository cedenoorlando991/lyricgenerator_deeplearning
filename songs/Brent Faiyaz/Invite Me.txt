14 ContributorsInvite Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Make up your mind
I know you're wondering why
I see this shit ain't as easy as it once was
But I'm sure you'll be fine

[Pre-Chorus]
Beauty ain't no issue for someone like you
You should know better
Cause there ain't no better

[Chorus]
Invite me, don't be ashamed
Girl don't fight me
I ain't running no game
Though I can't lie
When you deny
It kind of excites me

[Verse 2]
Make up your mind
This shit ain't rocket science
Girl I apologize, if I can't stay the night
I just got so much shit on my mind

[Bridge]
Beauty ain't no issue for someone like you
You should know better
Cause there ain't no better
You might also like[Chorus]
Invite me, don't be ashamed
Girl don't fight me
I ain't running no game
Though I can't lie
When you deny
It kind of excites me

[Outro]
Girl you so beautiful, don't be ashamed (girl don't be ashamed)
Girl you so beautiful, don't be ashamed (running no game)
Don't be ashamed (girl don't be ashamed)
Beauty is no issue
Don't be ashamed6Embed
