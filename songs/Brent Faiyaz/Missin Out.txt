18 ContributorsMissin Out Lyrics[Chorus]
You're missin' out, you're missin' out
You're missin' out, missin' out
You're missin' out, you're missin' out
You're missin' out

[Verse 1]
I just got off
I'm waitin' on a friend to scoop me up
Oh, it's hella cold out
But I had to get a way to call you up
I just got back from L.A
Yes, I plan to move
And I know that's what they all say
But I'ma be someone to know soon

[Pre-Chorus]
Come fuck with me
I ain't got no plans for the weekend
Don't know what you was thinkin'
But I don't got no drinks for drinkin'
I got some weed for smokin'
And I got some songs for listenin'
No, I don't got work in the mornin'
Shit, you don't know what you're missin'
You might also like[Chorus]
You're missin' out, you're missin' out
You're missin' out, missin' out
You're missin' out, you're missin' out
You're missin' out, missin' out

[Verse 2]
I just got off
My friend is takin' longer than I thought
I'm sittin' in a Starbucks
It was gettin' late and too cold out
Damn my feet are gettin' tired
I ain't tryna move
I'll call you back on Saturday
But I think I'ma go to bed soon

[Pre-Chorus]
Come fuck with me
I ain't got no plans for the weekend
Don't know what you was thinkin'
But I don't got no drinks for drinkin'
I got some weed for smokin'
And I got some songs for listenin'
No, I don't got work in the mornin'
Shit, you don't know what you're missin'
[Chorus]
You're missin' out, you're missin' out
You're missin' out, missin' out
You're missin' out, you're missin' out
You're missin' out, missin' out

[Outro]
I just got off2Embed
