18 ContributorsNeeded Lyrics[Verse 1]
Save your breath, don't even speak on me now
You and your friends, ran my name to the ground
You left me then, so I figured it out
Save your tongue, don't even give me a call
If I was a bum, you wouldn't call me at all
I don't say it enough, I'm gettin' tired of y'all

[Chorus]
Ohh, you say you're so happy for me
That you always knew what I would be
Where was the love when it was needed?
Ohh, you say that now I'm all you see
And you always saw the light in me
Where was the light when it was needed?

[Verse 2]
Why you feel the need to apologize to me?
Some may call it out, I just call it how I see
Loved me when you knew me
You just ain't want anybody to know
I changed my number twice and you called again
Heard that I was movin' and asked all my friends where to
If I don't wanna be close, it's nothing personal

[Chorus]
Ohh, you say you're so happy for me
Said you always knew what I would be
Where was the love when it was needed?
Ohh, you say that now I'm all you see
And you always saw the light in me
Where was the light when it was needed?
You might also like[Bridge]
I don't want a reason you didn't believe in me
That's your decision, don't get me wrong
I know you'd come around over time
I don't need your blessing
Don't need you protestin' how I live my life
I'm tryin', I'm fine

[Chorus]
Ohh, you say you're so happy for me
That you always knew what I would be
Where was the love when it was needed?
Ohh, you say that now I'm all you see
And you always saw the light in me
Where was the light when it was needed?9Embed
