18 ContributorsAllure Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl when you wear them heels
It's like you're making a deal with the devil
You try to lure me in
I'm not ready to go

[Hook]
Girl you be gettin ran through
Poppin in the mornin
Girl you be gettin ran through
Poppin in the early mornin

[Verse 2]
Stuck in my ways
And I ain't never met a soul like you, that came from money
It's not for attention, it's not for attention no more
Girl your looks could commit murder
But girl can't nothing hurt us now
Ain't none of my niggas not rollin now
Ain't none of my niggas not loadin now

[Hook]
Ran through
Poppin in the mornin
Girl you be gettin ran through
Poppin in the early mornin
Girl you be gettin ran through
Poppin in the mornin
Girl you be gettin ran through
Poppin in the early morninYou might also like1Embed
