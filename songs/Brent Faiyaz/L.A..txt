29 ContributorsL.A. Lyrics[Intro]
City of angels
Land of God
A city of demons
Land for us
In the city of angels
In the land of God
In the city of demons
That's the land for us?

[Verse 1]
L.A., L.A, the place of all places
Drug use and doll faces
Can make or break ya
I stood off by the wall and watched them skip the line
One night it's gon' be me inside
God damn, it ain't easy, let me tell ya
Account is overdrawn
Doin' sessions in the valley every other night
Connections only get you so far, so far
But oh, what a feeling (How it feels) oh, what a thrill (You would kill)
To look down from these hills, put the life I knew behind, but still
It's don't feel for real, 'cause I still ain't ate a meal
My stomach growlin' but I'm fuckin' stylin'
Spent my last 20 drunk, and Uber ridin'
Ain't nobody cuttin' checks, if you ain't happy smilin'
That's shit takes all the talent, yeah
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And it ain't easy, let me tell ya, account is overdrawn
Doin' sessions in the valley every other night and it goes on and on

[Chorus]
Yet, I'm proud that I'm chasin' something
It's all in all better than bein' broke, bored, and back at home
Oh, yes, it's all about makin' somethin'
That's all in all bigger than anything I'd ever known

[Verse 2]
L.A, L.A, the sun can shine vicious
Poor folks and tall riches, and plus the bitches
I stood off by the wall and watched 'em pick a side
One day from now, we all could die
God damn, it ain't easy, let me tell ya
Account is overdrawn
Doin' sessions in the valley every other night
Connections only get you so far, so far
But oh, what a feelin' (How it feels) oh, what a thrill (You would kill)
To look down from these hills, put the life I knew behind, but still
This don't feel for real, 'cause I still can't cut a deal
I want a Rollie, but it's movin' slowly
Spent my last 20 buyin' drinks for homies
And everybody want to know me, just to say, "You owe me"
This shit been gettin' phony, damn
[Pre-Chorus]
And it ain't easy, let me tell ya, account is overdrawn
Doing sessions in the valley every other night, that shit goes on and on

[Chorus]
Yet, I'm proud that I'm chasin' something
It's all in all better than bein' broke, bored, and back at home
Oh, yes, it's all about makin' somethin'
That's all in all bigger than anything I'd ever known6Embed
