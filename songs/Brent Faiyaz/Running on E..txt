How did you get that way?
(You don't even hide how you feel)
How did it get this way?
Ah, ah, ah
Make your decision
(You gonna regret it the rest of your life)
Now there's a consequence
Say you're seeing someone else
(Who can love you better than me?)
I'll leave you two alone, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now there's nothing left
(You messed up a good thing, a good thing)
So there's no coming home
[Chorus]
Girl remember my face
(For sure, for sure, for sure)
While you're out there on your own, oh, oh, oh
I can't tell where your heart is
(It's nowhere, it's nowhere to be found)
It's not there no more
See I don't need you
And I don't want to want you (Oh, oh)
If you step out the door
I won't wait up for you (Wait up)

Girl remember my face
(For sure, for sure, for sure)
While you're out there on your own, oh, oh, oh
I can't tell where your heart is
(It's nowhere, it's nowhere to be found)
It's not there no more
See I don't need you
And I don't want to want you
If you step out the door
I won't wait up for you (Wait up, wait up)2Embed
