26 ContributorsPAPER SOLDIER Lyrics[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
I bet you wish that I was still right there, used to live right there
Now I'm everywhere, got bitches everywhere
I'm so debonair, I'm a millionaire
I act like I don't care, that's 'cause I don't care
Still right there, used to live right there
Now I'm everywhere, got bitches everywhere
I'm so debonair, I'm a millionaire
I act like I don't care, that's 'cause I don't carе

[Verse 1: Brent Faiyaz]
Money come in, but you can't lose it, oh
Shе's tryna make love, I'm tryna make movies (Wait)
Woah, don't be cryin', bitch, I do this
I stunt for real, these niggas students
From the front, my bitch a beauty
From the back, look at that booty
She wanna parlay with my goonies
I'm tryna three way with her roommate, hey roomie

[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz & Joony]
I bet you wish that I was still right there, used to live right there
Now I'm everywhere, got bitches everywhere
I'm so debonair, I'm a millionaire
I act like I don't care, that's 'cause I don't care
Still right there, used to live right there
Now I'm everywhere, got bitches everywhere
I'm so debonair, I'm a millionaire (Thank God)
I act like I don't care (Yeah, uh), that's 'cause I don't care
You might also like[Verse 2: Joony]
I can't fail, baby, I'm a go-getter (Go-getter, oh, girl)
I just got home, I was road runnin' (Road runnin')
She can't leave me 'lone, she can't do no better (Do no better)
I love all my hoes, I love money better (Money better)
Ten bands, twenty bands, bet I stash that
Tables turn, bridges burn, live and learn
Fuckin' bad bitches, money first, wait your turn
I be goin' up, livin' different, niggas know it
I like my cup, I love my mom, I hate the feds (Hate the feds)
I'm in my city where they praise me like I'm dead (Like I'm dead)
I miss my bitch but I don't miss her like my dead homie (Like my dead homie)
I don't fuck with presidents until they dead on it

[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
I bet you wish that I was still right there, used to live right there
Now I'm everywhere, got bitches everywhere
I'm so debonair, I'm a millionaire
I act like I don't care, that's 'cause I don't care
Still right there, used to live right there
Now I'm everywhere, got bitches everywhere
I'm so debonair, I'm a millionaire
I act like I don't care, that's 'cause I don't care

[Outro]
You have one unheard message
Mister Brent Faiyaz, I know you see my DMs
I been DMing you for over three months now
I'm gonna need you to respond because I know you see them
I see you eatin' chicken, I see you smokin' weed
I see you drinkin', and makin', actually, you're barely makin' music
I'ma need you to drop more songs 'cause "Dead Man Walking" was not satis-I was not satisfied with it because I had already heard it before
And I'm gonna need you to drop a whole album this new year
2021, I expect more from you
This is ridiculous, it is very ridiculous
So, you need to res—
